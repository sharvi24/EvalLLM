Passage: Protagoras.Analysis.The Protagoras, like several of the Dialogues of Plato, is put into the mouth of Socrates, who describes a conversation which had taken place between himself and the great Sophist at the house of Callias\u2014\u2018the man who had spent more upon the Sophists than all the rest of the world\u2019\u2014and in which the learned Hippias and the grammarian Prodicus had also shared, as well as Alcibiades and Critias, both of whom said a few words\u2014in the presence of a distinguished company consisting of disciples of Protagoras and of leading Athenians belonging to the Socraticcircle. The dialogue commences with a request on the part of Hippocrates that Socrates would introduce him to the celebrated teacher. He has come before the dawn had risen\u2014so fervid is his zeal. Socrates moderates his excitement and advises him to find out \u2018what Protagoras will make of him,\u2019 before he becomes his pupil.They go together to the house of Callias; and Socrates, after explaining the purpose of their visit to Protagoras, asks the question, \u2018What he will make of Hippocrates.\u2019 Protagoras answers, \u2018That he will make him a better and a wiser man.\u2019 \u2018But in what will he be better?\u2019\u2014Socrates desires to have a more precise answer. Protagoras replies, \u2018That he will teach him prudence in affairs private and public; in short, the science or knowledge of human life.\u2019This, as Socrates admits, is a noble profession; but he is or rather would have been doubtful, whether such knowledge can be taught, if Protagoras had not assured him of the fact, for two reasons: (1) Because the Athenian people, who recognize in their assemblies the distinction between the skilled and the unskilled in the arts, do not distinguish between the trained politician and the untrained; (2) Because the wisest and best Athenian citizens do not teach their sons political virtue.

These are not, like the arts, to be imparted to a few only, but all men are to be partakers of them. Therefore the Athenian people are right in distinguishing between the skilled and unskilled in the arts, and not between skilled and unskilled politicians. (1) For all men have the political virtues to a certain degree, and are obliged to say that they have them, whether they have them or not. A man would be thought a madman who professed an art which he did not know; but he would be equally thought a madman if he did not profess a virtue which he had not. (2) And that the political virtues can be taught and acquired, in the opinion of the Athenians, is proved by the fact that they punish evil\u2013doers, with a view to prevention, of course\u2014mere retribution is for beasts, and not for men. (3) Again, would parents who teach their sons lesser matters leave them ignorant of the common duty of citizens? To the doubt of Socrates the best answer is the fact, that the education of youth in virtue begins almost as soon as they can speak, and is continued by the state when they pass out of the parental control. (4) Nor need we wonder that wise and good fathers sometimes have foolish and worthless sons. Virtue, as we were saying, is not the private possession of any man, but is shared by all, only however to the extent of which each individual is by nature capable. And, as a matter of fact, even the worst of civilized mankind will appear virtuous and just, if we compare them with savages. (5) The error of Socrates lies in supposing that there are no teachers of virtue, whereas all men are teachers in a degree. Some, like Protagoras, are better than others, and with this result we ought to be satisfied."}, {"prompt": "I will give you a passage and a question, please provide a precise answer. Passage: Socrates is highly delighted with the explanation of Protagoras. But he has still a doubt lingering in his mind. Protagoras has spoken of the virtues: are they many, or one? are they parts of a whole, or different names of the same thing? Protagoras replies that they are parts, like the parts of a face, which have their several functions, and no one part is like any other part. This admission, which has been somewhat hastily made, is now taken up and cross\u2013examined by Socrates:\u2014\u2018Is justice just, and is holiness holy? And are justice and holiness opposed to one another?\u2019\u2014\u2018Then justice is unholy.\u2019 Protagoras would rather say that justice is different from holiness, and yet in a certain point of view nearly the same. He does not, however, escape in this way from the cunning of Socrates, who inveigles him into an admission that everything has but one opposite. Folly, for example, is opposed to wisdom; and folly is also opposed to temperance; and therefore temperance and wisdom are the same. And holiness has been already admitted to be nearly the same as justice. Temperance, therefore, has now to be compared with justice.Protagoras, whose temper begins to get a little ruffled at the process to which he has been subjected, is aware that he will soon be compelled by the dialectics of Socrates to admit that the temperate is the just. He therefore defends himself with his favourite weapon; that is to say, he makes a long speech not much to the point, which elicits the applause of the audience.Here occurs a sort of interlude, which commences with a declaration on the part of Socrates that he cannot follow a long speech, and therefore he must beg Protagoras to speak shorter. As Protagoras declines to accommodate him, he rises to depart, but is detained by Callias, who thinks him unreasonable in not allowing Protagoras the liberty which he takes himself of speaking as he likes. But Alcibiades answers that the two cases are not parallel. For Socrates admits his inability to speak long; Based on the previous context answer this question:  will Protagoras in like manner acknowledge his inability to speak short?.

To this the latter yields a reluctant assent."}, {"prompt": "I will give you a long passage in parts, answer the question at end. Passage: Protagoras selects as his thesis a poem of Simonides of Ceos, in which he professes to find a contradiction. First the poet says,\u2018Hard is it to become good,\u2019and then reproaches Pittacus for having said, \u2018Hard is it to be good.\u2019 How is this to be reconciled? Socrates, who is familiar with the poem, is embarrassed at first, and invokes the aid of Prodicus, the countryman of Simonides, but apparently only with the intention of flattering him into absurdities. First a distinction is drawn between (\u03b5\u0269\u0313\u0302\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9) to be, and (\u03bb\u03b5\u03bd\u03ad\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9) to become: to become good is difficult; to be good is easy. Then the word difficult or hard is explained to mean \u2018evil\u2019 in the Cean dialect. To all this Prodicus assents; but when Protagoras reclaims, Socrates slily withdraws Prodicus from the fray, under the pretence that his assent was only intended to test the wits of his adversary. He then proceeds to give another and more elaborate explanation of the whole passage. The explanation is as follows:\u2014The Lacedaemonians are great philosophers (although this is a fact which is not generally known); and the soul of their philosophy is brevity, which was also the style of primitive antiquity and of the seven sages. Now Pittacus had a saying, \u2018Hard is it to be good:\u2019 and Simonides, who was jealous of the fame of this saying, wrote a poem which was designed to controvert it. No, says he, Pittacus; not \u2018hard to be good,\u2019 but \u2018hard to become good.\u2019 Socrates proceeds to argue in a highly impressive manner that the whole composition is intended as an attack upon Pittacus. This, though manifestly absurd, is accepted by the company, and meets with the special approval of Hippias, who has however a favourite interpretation of his own, which he is requested by Alcibiades to defer.The argument is now resumed, not without some disdainful remarks of Socrates on the practice of introducing the poets, who ought not to be allowed, any more than flute\u2013girls, to come into good society. Men\u2019s own thoughts should supply them with the materials for discussion. A few soothing flatteries are addressed to Protagoras by Callias and Socrates, and then the old question is repeated, \u2018Whether the virtues are one or many?\u2019 To which Protagoras is now disposed to reply, that four out of the five virtues are in some degree similar; but he still contends that the fifth, courage, is unlike the rest. Socrates proceeds to undermine the last stronghold of the adversary, first obtaining from him the admission that all virtue is in the highest degree good:\u2014The courageous are the confident; and the confident are those who know their business or profession: those who have no such knowledge and are still confident are madmen. This is admitted. Then, says Socrates, courage is knowledge\u2014an inference which Protagoras evades by drawing a futile distinction between the courageous and the confident in a fluent speech.Socrates renews the attack from another side: he would like to know whether pleasure is not the only good, and pain the only evil? Protagoras seems to doubt the morality or propriety of assenting to this; he would rather say that \u2018some pleasures are good, some pains are evil,\u2019 which is also the opinion of the generality of mankind. What does he think of knowledge? Does he agree with the common opinion that knowledge is overcome by passion? or does he hold that knowledge is power? Protagoras agrees that knowledge is certainly a governing power.This, however, is not the doctrine of men in general, who maintain that many who know what is best, act contrary to their knowledge under the influence of pleasure. But this opposition of good and evil is really the opposition of a greater or lesser amount of pleasure. Pleasures are evils because they end in pain, and pains are goods because they end in pleasures. Thus pleasure is seen to be the only good; and the only evil is the prillegibleence of the lesser pleasure to the greater. But then comes in the illusion of distance. Some art of mensuration is required in order to ", "output": "\u0153conomize our pleasures. If we have a moderate share of pleasure, we are happy; but if we have a great share, we are miserable. To make the best of our pleasures, we must know the quantity of them which is sufficient for happiness. This is the lesson which the poets teach us, and which the wise man must learn. We are to have as much pleasure as is consistent with happiness, and no more. But this is not the doctrine of the common herd, who have no idea of the art of \u0153conomy, and who, if they were asked what they would", "target": null}, {"prompt": "show us pleasures and pains in their true proportion. This art of mensuration is a kind of knowledge, and knowledge is thus proved once more to be the governing principle of human life, and ignorance the origin of all evil: for no one prefers the less pleasure to the greater, or the greater pain to the less, except from ignorance. The argument is drawn out in an imaginary \u2018dialogue within a dialogue,\u2019 conducted by Socrates and Protagoras on the one part, and the rest of the world on the other. Hippias and Prodicus, as well as Protagoras, admit the soundness of the conclusion.Socrates then applies this new conclusion to the case of courage\u2014the only virtue which still holds out against the assaults of the Socratic dialectic. No one chooses the evil or refuses the good except through ignorance. This explains why cowards refuse to go to war:\u2014because they form a wrong estimate of good, and honour, and pleasure. And why are the courageous willing to go to war?\u2014because they form a right estimate of pleasures and pains, of things terrible and not terrible. Courage then is knowledge, and cowardice is ignorance. And the five virtues, which were originally maintained to have five different natures, after having been easily reduced to two only, at last coalesce in one. The assent of Protagoras to this last position is extracted with great difficulty.Socrates concludes by professing his disinterested love of the truth, and remarks on the singular manner in which he and his adversary had changed sides. Protagoras began by asserting, and Socrates by denying, the teachableness of virtue, and now the latter ends by affirming that virtue is knowledge, which is the most teachable of all things, while Protagoras has been striving to show that virtue is not knowledge, and this is almost equivalent to saying that virtue cannot be taught. He is not satisfied with the result, and would like to renew the enquiry with the help of Protagoras in a different order, asking (1) What virtue is, and (2) Whether virtue can be taught. Protagoras declines this offer, but commends Socrates\u2019 earnestness and his style of discussion.Introduction.The Protagoras is often supposed to be full of difficulties. These are partly imaginary and partly real. The imaginary ones are (1) Chronological,\u2014which were pointed out in ancient times by Athenaeus (v. 59), and are noticed by Schleiermacher and others, and relate to the impossibility of all the persons in the Dialogue meeting at any one time, whether in the year 425 b.c., or in any other. But Plato, like all writers of fiction, aims only at the probable, and shows in many Dialogues (e.g. the Symposium and Republic, and already in the Laches) an extreme disregard of the historical accuracy which is sometimes demanded of him. (2) The exact place of the Protagoras among the Dialogues, and the date of composition, have also been much disputed. But there are no criteria which afford any real grounds for determining the date of composition; and the affinities of the Dialogues, when they are not indicated by Plato himself, must always to a great extent remain uncertain. (3) There is another class of difficulties, which may be ascribed to preconceived notions of commentators, who imagine that Protagoras the Sophist ought always to be in the wrong, and his adversary Socrates in the right; or that in this or that passage\u2014e.g. in the explanation of good as pleasure\u2014 Plato is inconsistent with himself; or that the Dialogue fails in unity, and has not a proper beginning, middle, and ending. They seem to forget that Plato is a dramatic writer who throws his thoughts into both sides of the argument, and certainly does not aim at any unity which is inconsistent with freedom, and with a natural or even wild manner of treating his subject; also that his mode of revealing the truth is by lights and shadows, and far\u2013off and opposing points of view, and not by dogmatic statements or definite results.The real difficulties arise out of the extreme subtlety of the work, which, as Socrates says of the poem of Simonides, is a most perfect pie", "output": "cing together of the parts, and a most perfect piece of work. The Dialogue is a kind of dialectic treatise, in which the truth is not to be found in any single sentence, but in the whole. The main difficulty is to see how the five virtues, as they are defined in the early part of the Dialogue, can be reduced to two, and how the definition of courage can be reconciled with the definition of virtue. The following are the chief difficulties which may be noticed:\u20141. The definition of courage in the early part of the Dialogue (vv. 11\u20131", "target": null}, {"prompt": "ce of art. There are dramatic contrasts and interests, threads of philosophy broken and resumed, satirical reflections on mankind, veils thrown over truths which are lightly suggested, and all woven together in a single design, and moving towards one end.In the introductory scene Plato raises the expectation that a \u2018great personage\u2019 is about to appear on the stage; perhaps with a further view of showing that he is destined to be overthrown by a greater still, who makes no pretensions. Before introducing Hippocrates to him, Socrates thinks proper to warn the youth against the dangers of \u2018influence,\u2019 of which the invidious nature is recognized by Protagoras himself. Hippocrates readily adopts the suggestion of Socrates that he shall learn of Protagoras only the accomplishments which befit an Athenian gentleman, and let alone his \u2018sophistry.\u2019 There is nothing however in the introduction which leads to the inference that Plato intended to blacken the character of the Sophists; he only makes a little merry at their expense.The \u2018great personage\u2019 is somewhat ostentatious, but frank and honest. He is introduced on a stage which is worthy of him\u2014at the house of the rich Callias, in which are congregated the noblest and wisest of the Athenians. He considers openness to be the best policy, and particularly mentions his own liberal mode of dealing with his pupils, as if in answer to the favourite accusation of the Sophists that they received pay. He is remarkable for the good temper which he exhibits throughout the discussion under the trying and often sophistical cross\u2013examination of Socrates. Although once or twice ruffled, and reluctant to continue the discussion, he parts company on perfectly good terms, and appears to be, as he says of himself, the \u2018least jealous of mankind.\u2019Nor is there anything in the sentiments of Protagoras which impairs this pleasing impression of the grave and weighty old man. His real defect is that he is inferior to Socrates in dialectics. The opposition between him and Socrates is not the opposition of good and bad, true and false, but of the old art of rhetoric and the new science of interrogation and argument; also of the irony of Socrates and the self\u2013assertion of the Sophists. There is quite as much truth on the side of Protagoras as of Socrates; but the truth of Protagoras is based on common sense and common maxims of morality, while that of Socrates is paradoxical or transcendental, and though full of meaning and insight, hardly intelligible to the rest of mankind. Here as elsewhere is the usual contrast between the Sophists representing average public opinion and Socrates seeking for increased clearness and unity of ideas. But to a great extent Protagoras has the best of the argument and represents the better mind of man.For example: (1) one of the noblest statements to be found in antiquity about the preventive nature of punishment is put into his mouth; (2) he is clearly right also in maintaining that virtue can be taught (which Socrates himself, at the end of the Dialogue, is disposed to concede); and also (3) in his explanation of the phenomenon that good fathers have bad sons; (4) he is right also in observing that the virtues are not like the arts, gifts or attainments of special individuals, but the common property of all: this, which in all ages has been the strength and weakness of ethics and politics, is deeply seated in human nature; (5) there is a sort of half\u2013truth in the notion that all civilized men are teachers of virtue; and more than a half\u2013truth (6) in ascribing to man, who in his outward conditions is more helpless than the other animals, the power of self\u2013improvement; (7) the religious allegory should be noticed, in which the arts are said to be given by Prometheus (who stole them), whereas justice and reverence and the political virtues could only be imparted by Zeus; (8) in the latter part of the Dialogue, when Socrates is arguing that \u2018pleasure is the only good,\u2019 Protagoras deems it more in accordance with his character to maintain that \u2018some pleasures only are good;\u2019 and", "output": "this is also the view of the Sophists, that the pleasures are divided into good and bad, and that the good are the only ones which are to be pursued. Thus, on the whole, Protagoras is a personage of the first order; and though he may be thought to be a little too self\u2013confident, he is not a man to be despised.The \u2018Sophist\u2019 is the last of the great Platonic Dialogues. It is a work of extreme difficulty, and perhaps of no ordinary interest. The only other Dialogue which approaches it in difficulty is the \u2018C", "target": null}, {"prompt": " admits that \u2018he, above all other men, is bound to say \u201cthat wisdom and knowledge are the highest of human things.\u201d\u2019There is no reason to suppose that in all this Plato is depicting an imaginary Protagoras; he seems to be showing us the teaching of the Sophists under the milder aspect under which he once regarded them. Nor is there any reason to doubt that Socrates is equally an historical character, paradoxical, ironical, tiresome, but seeking for the unity of virtue and knowledge as for a precious treasure; willing to rest this even on a calculation of pleasure, and irresistible here, as everywhere in Plato, in his intellectual superiority.The aim of Socrates, and of the Dialogue, is to show the unity of virtue. In the determination of this question the identity of virtue and knowledge is found to be involved. But if virtue and knowledge are one, then virtue can be taught; the end of the Dialogue returns to the beginning. Had Protagoras been allowed by Plato to make the Aristotelian distinction, and say that virtue is not knowledge, but is accompanied with knowledge; or to point out with Aristotle that the same quality may have more than one opposite; or with Plato himself in the Phaedo to deny that good is a mere exchange of a greater pleasure for a less\u2014the unity of virtue and the identity of virtue and knowledge would have required to be proved by other arguments.The victory of Socrates over Protagoras is in every way complete when their minds are fairly brought together. Protagoras falls before him after two or three blows. Socrates partially gains his object in the first part of the Dialogue, and completely in the second. Nor does he appear at any disadvantage when subjected to \u2018the question\u2019 by Protagoras. He succeeds in making his two \u2018friends,\u2019 Prodicus and Hippias, ludicrous by the way; he also makes a long speech in defence of the poem of Simonides, after the manner of the Sophists, showing, as Alcibiades says, that he is only pretending to have a bad memory, and that he and not Protagoras is really a master in the two styles of speaking; and that he can undertake, not one side of the argument only, but both, when Protagoras begins to break down. Against the authority of the poets with whom Protagoras has ingeniously identified himself at the commencement of the Dialogue, Socrates sets up the proverbial philosophers and those masters of brevity the Lacedaemonians. The poets, the Laconizers, and Protagoras are satirized at the same time.Not having the whole of this poem before us, it is impossible for us to answer certainly the question of Protagoras, how the two passages of Simonides are to be reconciled. We can only follow the indications given by Plato himself. But it seems likely that the reconcilement offered by Socrates is a caricature of the methods of interpretation which were practised by the Sophists\u2014for the following reasons: (1) The transparent irony of the previous interpretations given by Socrates. (2) The ludicrous opening of the speech in which the Lacedaemonians are described as the true philosophers, and Laconic brevity as the true form of philosophy, evidently with an allusion to Protagoras\u2019 long speeches. (3) The manifest futility and absurdity of the explanation of \u1f10\u03bc\u0175\u03bd \u1f10\u03c0\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9 \u1f00\u03bb\u03b1\u03b8\u03ad\u03c9\u03c2, which is hardly consistent with the rational interpretation of the rest of the poem. The opposition of \u03b5\u0269\u0313\u0302\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 and \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03ad\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 seems also intended to express the rival doctrines of Socrates and Protagoras, and is a facetious commentary on their differences. (4) The general treatment in Plato both of the Poets and the Sophists, who are their interpreters, and whom he delights to identify with them. (5) The depreciating spirit in which Socrates speaks of the introduction of the poets as a substitute for original conversation, which is intended to contrast with Protagoras\u2019 exaltation of the study of them\u2014this again is hardly consistent with the serious defence of Simonides. (6) The marked approval of Hippias, who is supposed at once to catch the familiar sound, just as in the previous conversation Prodicus is re", "output": "buked for the same fault. (7) The contrast of the serious and the ludicrous. The former is in the case of the Laconizers; the latter is in the case of Hippias. (8) The abrupt termination of the speech. The whole speech is a caricature of the manner of the Sophists, and is intended to show the superiority of Socrates.The second part of the Dialogue is equally successful. The victory of Socrates is more complete, and more interesting. The triumph of Protagoras is not a defeat, but a confession.", "target": null}, {"prompt": "presented as ready to accept any distinctions of language however absurd. At the same time Hippias is desirous of substituting a new interpretation of his own; as if the words might really be made to mean anything, and were only to be regarded as affording a field for the ingenuity of the interpreter.This curious passage is, therefore, to be regarded as Plato\u2019s satire on the tedious and hypercritical arts of interpretation which prevailed in his own day, and may be compared with his condemnation of the same arts when applied to mythology in the Phaedrus, and with his other parodies, e. g. with the two first speeches in the Phaedrus and with the Menexenus. Several lesser touches of satire may be observed, such as the claim of philosophy advanced for the Lacedaemonians, which is a parody of the claims advanced for the Poets by Protagoras; the mistake of the Laconizing set in supposing that the Lacedaemonians are a great nation because they bruise their ears; the far\u2013fetched notion, which is \u2018really too bad,\u2019 that Simonides uses the Lesbian (?) word, \u1f10\u03c0\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9, because he is addressing a Lesbian. The whole may also be considered as a satire on those who spin pompous theories out of nothing. As in the arguments of the Euthydemus and of the Cratylus, the veil of irony is never withdrawn; and we are left in doubt at last how far in this interpretation of Simonides Socrates is \u2018fooling,\u2019 how far he is in earnest.All the interests and contrasts of character in a great dramatic work like the Protagoras are not easily exhausted. The impressiveness of the scene should not be lost upon us, or the gradual substitution of Socrates in the second part for Protagoras in the first. The characters to whom we are introduced at the beginning of the Dialogue all play a part more or less conspicuous towards the end. There is Alcibiades, who is compelled by the necessity of his nature to be a partisan, lending effectual aid to Socrates; there is Critias assuming the tone of impartiality; Callias, here as always inclining to the Sophists, but eager for any intellectual repast; Prodicus, who finds an opportunity for displaying his distinctions of language, which are valueless and pedantic, because they are not based on dialectic; Hippias, who has previously exhibited his superficial knowledge of natural philosophy, to which, as in both the Dialogues called by his name, he now adds the profession of an interpreter of the Poets. The two latter personages have been already damaged by the mock heroic description of them in the introduction. It may be remarked that Protagoras is consistently presented to us throughout as the teacher of moral and political virtue; there is no allusion to the theories of sensation which are attributed to him in the Theaetetus and elsewhere, or to his denial of the existence of the gods in a well\u2013known fragment ascribed to him; he is the religious rather than the irreligious teacher in this Dialogue. Also it may be observed that Socrates shows him as much respect as is consistent with his own ironical character; he admits that the dialectic which has overthrown Protagoras has carried himself round to a conclusion opposed to his first thesis. The force of argument, therefore, and not Socrates or Protagoras, has won the day.But is Socrates serious in maintaining (1) that virtue cannot be taught; (2) that the virtues are one; (3) that virtue is the knowledge of pleasures and pains present and future? These propositions to us have an appearance of paradox\u2014they are really moments or aspects of the truth by the help of which we pass from the old conventional morality to a higher conception of virtue and knowledge. That virtue cannot be taught is a paradox of the same sort as the profession of Socrates that he knew nothing. Plato means to say that virtue is not brought to a man, but must be drawn out of him; and cannot be taught by rhetorical discourses or citations from the poets. The second question, whether the virtues are one or many, though at first sight distinct, is really a part of the same subject; for if the virtues ar", "output": "ising out of the appetites are many, the virtues arising out of the understanding are one. The third question, whether virtue is the knowledge of present and future pleasures and pains, is a paradox of the same sort as the paradox of the Theaetetus, that virtue is knowledge. Virtue is the knowledge of the good, and the good is pleasure and pain; and the knowledge of pleasure and pain is the knowledge of the good. The paradox is that pleasure and pain are not to be separated from good.\nThe paradoxes of the Protagoras", "target": null}, {"prompt": "e to be taught, they must be reducible to a common principle; and this common principle is found to be knowledge. Here, as Aristotle remarks, Socrates and Plato outstep the truth\u2014they make a part of virtue into the whole. Further, the nature of this knowledge, which is assumed to be a knowledge of pleasures and pains, appears to us too superficial and at variance with the spirit of Plato himself. Yet, in this, Plato is only following the historical Socrates as he is depicted to us in Xenophon\u2019s Memorabilia. Like Socrates, he finds on the surface of human life one common bond by which the virtues are united,\u2014their tendency to produce happiness,\u2014though such a principle is afterwards repudiated by him.It remains to be considered in what relation the Protagoras stands to the other Dialogues of Plato. That it is one of the earlier or purely Socratic works\u2014perhaps the last, as it is certainly the greatest of them\u2014is indicated by the absence of any allusion to the doctrine of reminiscence; and also by the different attitude assumed towards the teaching and persons of the Sophists in some of the later Dialogues. The Charmides, Laches, Lysis, all touch on the question of the relation of knowledge to virtue, and may be regarded, if not as preliminary studies or sketches of the more important work, at any rate as closely connected with it. The Io and the lesser Hippias contain discussions of the Poets, which offer a parallel to the ironical criticism of Simonides, and are conceived in a similar spirit. The affinity of the Protagoras to the Meno is more doubtful. For there, although the same question is discussed, \u2018whether virtue can be taught,\u2019 and the relation of Meno to the Sophists is much the same as that of Hippocrates, the answer to the question is supplied out of the doctrine of ideas; the real Socrates is already passing into the Platonic one. At a later stage of the Platonic philosophy we shall find that both the paradox and the solution of it appear to have been retracted. The Phaedo, the Gorgias, and the Philebus offer further corrections of the teaching of the Protagoras; in all of them the doctrine that virtue is pleasure, or that pleasure is the chief or only good, is distinctly renounced.Thus after many preparations and oppositions, both of the characters of men and aspects of the truth, especially of the popular and philosophical aspect; and after many interruptions and detentions by the way, which, as Theodorus says in the Theaetetus, are quite as agreeable as the argument, we arrive at the great Socratic thesis that virtue is knowledge. This is an aspect of the truth which was lost almost as soon as it was found; and yet has to be recovered by every one for himself who would pass the limits of proverbial and popular philosophy. The moral and intellectual are always dividing, yet they must be reunited, and in the highest conception of them are inseparable. The thesis of Socrates is not merely a hasty assumption, but may be also deemed an anticipation of some \u2018metaphysic of the future,\u2019 in which the divided elements of human nature are reconciled.PROTAGORAS.PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE.Socrates,who is the narrator of the Dialogue to his Companion.Hippocrates.Alcibiades.Critias.Protagoras,Sophists.Hippias,Sophists.Prodicus,Sophists.Callias,a wealthy Athenian.Scene:\u2014The House of Callias.Com.Protagoras.Companion, Socrates.The fair Alcibiades.Where do you come from, Socrates?

Passage: Surely, I said, knowledge is the food of the soul; and we must take care, my friend, that the Sophist does not deceive us when he praises what he sells, like the dealers wholesale or retail who sell the food of the body; for they praise indiscriminately all their goods, without knowing what are really beneficial or hurtful: neither do their customers know, with the exception of any trainer or physician who may happen to buy of them. In like manner those who carry about the wares of knowledge, and make the round of the cities, and sell or retail them to any customer who is in want of them, praise them all alike; though I should not wonder, O my friend, if many of them were really ignorant of their effect upon the soul; and their customers equally ignorant, unless he who buys of them happens to be a physician of the soul. If, therefore, you have understanding of what is good and evil,\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyou may safely buy knowledge of Protagoras or of any one; but if not, then, O my friend, pause, and do not hazard your dearest interests at a game of chance. For there is far greater peril in buying knowledge than in buying meat and drink: the one you purchase of the wholesale or retail dealer, and carry them away in other vessels, and before you receive them into the body as food, you may deposit them at home and call in any experienced friend who knows what is good to be eaten or drunken, and what not, and how much, and when; and then the danger of purchasing them is not so great. But you cannot buy the wares of knowledge and carry them away in another vessel; when you have paid for them you must receive them into the soul and go your way, either greatly harmed or greatly benefited; and therefore we should deliberate and take counsel with our elders; for we are still young\u2014too young to determine\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsuch a matter. And now let us go, as we were intending, and hear Protagoras; and when we have heard what he has to say, we may take counsel of others; for not only is Protagoras at the house of Callias, but there is Hippias of Elis, and, if I am not mistaken, Prodicus of Ceos, and several other wise men.The porter of the house shows that he is not a friend of the Sophists.Socrates pacifies him.To this we agreed, and proceeded on our way until we reached the vestibule of the house; and there we stopped in order to conclude a discussion which had arisen between us as we were going along; and we stood talking in the vestibule until we had finished and come to an understanding. And I think that the door\u2013keeper, who was a eunuch, and who was probably annoyed at the great inroad of the Sophists, must have heard us talking. At any rate, when we knocked at the door, and he opened and saw us, he grumbled: They are Sophists\u2014he is not at home; and instantly gave the door a hearty bang with both his hands. Again we knocked, and he answered without opening: Did you not hear me say that he is not at home, fellows? But, my friend, I said, you need not be alarmed; for we are not Sophists, and we are not come to see Callias, but we want to see Protagoras; and I must\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trequest you to announce us. At last, after a good deal of difficulty, the man was persuaded to open the door.A well\u2013trained band of listeners accompany Protagoras while walking in the cloister.When we entered, we found Protagoras taking a walk in the cloister; and next to him, on one side, were walking Callias, the son of Hipponicus, and Paralus, the son of Pericles, who, by the mother\u2019s side, is his half\u2013brother, and Charmides, the son of Glaucon. On the other side of him were Xanthippus, the other son of Pericles, Philippides, the son of Philomelus; also Antimoerus of Mende, who of all the disciples of Protagoras is the most famous, and intends to make sophistry his profession. A train of listeners followed him; the greater part of them appeared to be foreigners, whom Protagoras had brought with him out of the various cities visited by him in his journeys, he, like Orpheus, attracting them by his voice, a", "output": "great crowd of them, and of the natives of Athens also, who had heard of his reputation.

Nothing delighted me more than the precision of their movements: they never got into his way at all; but when he and those who were with him turned back, then the band of listeners parted regularly on either side; he was always in front, and they wheeled round and took their places behind him in perfect order.Hippias is seated in the opposite cloister.After him, as Homer says2, \u2018I lifted up my eyes and saw\u2019 Hippias the Elean sitting in the opposite cloister on a chair of state, and around him were seated on benches Eryximachus, the son of Acumenus, and Phaedrus the Myrrhinusian, and Andron the son of Androtion, and there were strangers whom he had brought with him from his native city of Elis, and some others: they were putting to Hippias certain physical and astronomical questions, and he, ex cathedr\u00e2, was determining their several questions to them, and discoursing of them.Prodicus in the store\u2013house, still in bed.Pausanias the lover of Agathon.Also, \u2018my eyes beheld Tantalus3;\u2019 for Prodicus the Cean was at Athens: he had been lodged in a room which, in the days of Hipponicus, was a storehouse; but, as the house was full, Callias had cleared this out and made the room into a guest\u2013chamber. Now Prodicus was still in bed, wrapped up in sheepskins and bedclothes, of which there seemed to be a great heap; and there was sitting by him on the couches near, Pausanias of the deme of Cerameis, and with Pausanias was a youth quite young, who is certainly remarkable for his good looks, and, if I am not mistaken, is also of a fair and gentle nature. I thought that I heard him called Agathon, and my suspicion is that he is the beloved of Pausanias. There was this youth, and also there were the two Adeimantuses, one the son of Cepis, and the other of Leucolophides, and some others. I was very anxious to hear what Prodicus was saying, for he seems to me to be an all\u2013wise and\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinspired man; but I was not able to get into the inner circle, and his fine deep voice made an echo in the room which rendered his words inaudible.Alcibiades makes his appearance.No sooner had we entered than there followed us Alcibiades the beautiful, as you say, and I believe you; and also Critias the son of Callaeschrus.On entering we stopped a little, in order to look about us, and then walked up to Protagoras, and I said: Protagoras, my friend Hippocrates and I have come to see you.", "output": "He replied: I am very glad to see you, Hippocrates, and I wish that you would come to my house.Hippocrates: I should like to come, but I must wait till I have seen Prodicus.Protagoras: Very well, come when you like.

Passage: And what is your purpose? he said.Hippocrates and Socrates approach Protagoras, who enlarges upon the antiquity of his art and upon the jealousies and suspicions which are entertained of him.I must explain, I said, that my friend Hippocrates is a native Athenian; he is the son of Apollodorus, and of a great and prosperous house, and he is himself in natural ability quite a match for anybody of his own age. I believe that he aspires to political eminence; and this he thinks that conversation with you is most likely to procure for him. And now you can determine whether you would wish to speak to him of your teaching alone or in the presence of the company.The Sophists of old concealed themselves under the names of poets and musicians, but Protagoras thinks that openness is the best policy.Thank you, Socrates, for your consideration of me. For certainly a stranger finding his way into great cities, and persuading the flower of the youth in them to leave the company of their kinsmen or any other acquaintances, old or young, and live with him, under the idea that they will be improved by his conversation, ought to be very cautious; great jealousies are aroused by his proceedings, and he is the subject of many enmities and conspiracies. Now the art of the Sophist is, as I believe, of great antiquity; but in ancient times those who practised it, fearing this odium, veiled and disguised themselves under various names, some under that of poets, as Homer, Hesiod, and Simonides, some, of hierophants and prophets, as Orpheus and Musaeus, and some, as I observe, even under the name of gymnasticmasters, like Iccus of Tarentum, or the more recently celebrated Herodicus, now of\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSelymbria and formerly of Megara, who is a first\u2013rate Sophist. Your own Agathocles pretended to be a musician, but was really an eminent Sophist; also Pythocleides the Cean; and there were many others; and all of them, as I was saying, adopted these arts as veils or disguises because they were afraid of the odium which they would incur. But that is not my way, for I do not believe that they effected their purpose, which was to deceive the government, who were not blinded by them; and as to the people, they have no understanding, and only repeat what their rulers are pleased to tell them. Now to run away, and to be caught in running away, is the very height of folly, and also greatly increases the exasperation of mankind; for they regard him who runs away as a rogue, in addition to any other objections which they have to him; and therefore I take an entirely opposite course, and acknowledge myself to\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbe a Sophist and instructor of mankind; such an open acknowledgment appears to me to be a better sort of caution than concealment. Nor do I neglect other precautions, and therefore I hope, as I may say, by the favour of heaven that no harm will come of the acknowledgment that I am a Sophist. And I have been now many years in the profession\u2014for all my years when added up are many: there is no one here present of whom I might not be the father.

Protagoras promises to do so in an apologue.Then, I said, you do indeed possess a noble art, if there is no mistake about this; for I will freely confess to you, Protagoras, that I have a doubt whether this art is capable of being taught, and yet I know not how to disbelieve your assertion. And I ought to tell you why I am of opinion that this art cannot be taught or communicated by man to man. I say that the Athenians are an understanding people, and indeed they are esteemed to be such by the other Hellenes. Now I observe that when we are met together in the assembly, and the matter in hand relates to building, the builders are summoned as advisers; when the question is one of ship\u2013building, then the ship\u2013wrights; and the like of other arts which they think capable of being taught and learned.

And not only is this true of the state, but of individuals; the best and wisest of our citizens are unable to impart their political wisdom to others: as for\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\texample, Pericles, the father of these young men, who gave them excellent instruction in all that could be learned from masters, in his own department of politics neither taught them, nor gave them teachers; but they were allowed to wander at their own free will in a sort of hope that they would light upon virtue of their own accord. Or take another example: there was Cleinias the younger brother of our friend Alcibiades, of whom this very same Pericles was the guardian; and he being in fact under the apprehension that Cleinias would be corrupted by Alcibiades, took him away, and placed him in the house of Ariphron to be educated; but before six months had elapsed, Ariphron sent him back, not knowing what to do with him. And I could mention numberless other instances of persons who were good themselves, and never yet made any one else good, whether friend or stranger. Now I, Protagoras, having these examples before me, am inclined to think that virtue cannot be\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttaught. But then again, when I listen to your words, I waver; and am disposed to think that there must be something in what you say, because I know that you have great experience, and learning, and invention.

Passage: Well, then, he said, I think that the myth will be more interesting.The creation of the brute animals, who were equipped with the qualities necessary for their preservation, while men remained naked and defenceless.To meet this need of theirs Prometheus stole the arts of Athene and Hephaestus, together with fire.Once upon a time there were gods only, and no mortal creatures. But when the time came that these also should be created, the gods fashioned them out of earth and fire and various mixtures of both elements in the interior of the earth; and when they were about to bring them into the light of day, they ordered Prometheus and Epimetheus to equip them, and to distribute to them severally their proper qualities. Epimetheus said to Prometheus: \u2018Let me distribute, and do you inspect.\u2019 This was agreed, and Epimetheus made the distribution. There were some to whom he gave strength without swiftness, while he equipped the weaker with swiftness; some he armed, and others he left unarmed; and devised for the latter some other means of preservation, making some large, and having their size as a protection, and others small, whose nature was to fly in the air or burrow in the ground; this was to be\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir way of escape. Thus did he compensate them with the view of preventing any race from becoming extinct. And when he had provided against their destruction by one another, he contrived also a means of protecting them against the seasons of heaven; clothing them with close hair and thick skins sufficient to defend them against the winter cold and able to resist the summer heat, so that they might have a natural bed of their own when they wanted to rest; also he furnished them with hoofs and hair and hard and callous skins under their feet. Then he gave them varieties of food,\u2014herb of the soil to some, to others fruits of trees, and to others roots, and to some again he gave other animals as food. And some he made to have few young ones, while those who were their prey were very prolific; and in this manner the race was preserved. Thus did Epimetheus, who, not being very wise, forgot that he had\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdistributed among the brute animals all the qualities which he had to give,\u2014and when he came to man, who was still unprovided, he was terribly perplexed. Now while he was in this perplexity, Prometheus came to inspect the distribution, and he found that the other animals were suitably furnished, but that man alone was naked and shoeless, and had neither bed nor arms of defence. The appointed hour was approaching when man in his turn was to go forth into the light of day; and Prometheus, not knowing how he could devise his salvation, stole the mechanical arts of Hephaestus and Athene, and fire with them (they could neither have been acquired nor used without fire), and gave them to man. Thus man had the wisdom necessary to the support of life, but political wisdom he had not; for that was in the keeping of Zeus, and the power of Prometheus did not extend to entering into the citadel of heaven, where Zeus dwelt, who moreover\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad terrible sentinels; but he did enter by stealth into the common workshop of Athene and Hephaestus, in which they used to practise their favourite arts, and carried off Hephaestus\u2019 art of working by fire, and also the art of Athene, and gave them to man. And in this way man was supplied with the means of life. But Prometheus is said to have been afterwards prosecuted for theft, owing to the blunder of Epimetheus.But men were still destitute of political wisdom, and were in danger of being exterminated by the wild beasts.So to protect themselves they gathered into cities; but having no sense of right, they began to destroy one another. Hermes at the desire of Zeus imparted justice and reverence to them.These virtues were imparted not, like the arts, to a few only but to all. Now man, having a share of the divine attributes, was at first the only one of the animals who had any gods, because he alone was of their kindred; ", "output": "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbut afterwards he had many, and they became his servants.

He was not long in inventing articulate speech and names; and he also constructed houses and clothes and shoes and beds, and drew sustenance from the earth. Thus provided, mankind at first lived dispersed, and there were no cities. But the consequence was that they were destroyed by the wild beasts, for they were utterly weak in comparison of them, and their art was only sufficient to provide them with the means of life, and did not enable them to carry on war against the animals: food they had, but not as yet the art of government, of which the art of war is a part. After a while the desire of self\u2013preservation gathered them into cities; but when they were\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgathered together, having no art of government, they evil intreated one another, and were again in process of dispersion and destruction. Zeus feared that the entire race would be exterminated, and so he sent Hermes to them, bearing reverence and justice to be the ordering principles of cities and the bonds of friendship and conciliation. Hermes asked Zeus how he should impart justice and reverence among men:\u2014Should he distribute them as the arts are distributed; that is to say, to a favoured few only, one skilled individual having enough of medicine or of any other art for many unskilled ones? \u2018Shall this be the manner in which I am to distribute justice and reverence among men, or shall I give them to all?\u2019 \u2018To all,\u2019 said Zeus; \u2018I should like them all to have a share; for cities cannot exist, if a few only share in the virtues, as in the arts. And further, make a law\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby my order, that he who has no part in reverence and justice shall be put to death, for he is a plague of the state.\u2019And this is the reason, Socrates, why the Athenians and mankind in general, when the question relates to carpentering or any other mechanical art, allow but a few to share in their deliberations; and when any one else interferes, then, as you say, they object, if he be not of the favoured few; which, as I reply, is very natural. But when they meet to deliberate about political virtue, which proceeds only by way of justice and wisdom, they are patient enough of any man who speaks of them, as is also natural, because they think that every man ought to share in this sort of virtue, and that states could not exist if this were otherwise. I have explained to you, Socrates, the reason of this phenomenon.And certainly all men are expected to profess them,And that you may not suppose yourself to be deceived in thinking that all men regard every man as having a share of justice or honesty and of every other political virtue, let me give you a further proof, which is this. In other cases, as you are aware, if a man says that he is a good flute\u2013player, or skilful in any other art in which he has no skill, people either laugh at him or are angry with him, and his relations think that he is mad and go and admonish him; but when honesty is in question, or some other political virtue, even if they know that he is dishonest, yet, if the man comes publicly forward and tells the truth about his dishonesty, then, what in the other case was held by them to be good sense, they now deem to be madness. They say that all men ought to profess honesty whether they are honest or not, and that a man is out of his mind who says anything else. Their notion is, that a man\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmust have some degree of honesty; and that if he has none at all he ought not to be in the world.and are punished for the want of them, which is a proof that they can be acquired and taught.I have been showing that they are right in admitting every man as a counsellor about this sort of virtue, as they are of opinion that every man is a partaker of it. And I will now endeavour to show further that they do not conceive this virtue to be given by nature, or to grow spontaneously, but to be a thing which may be taught; and which comes to a man by taking pains. No one would instruct, no one would rebuke, or be angry with those whose calamities they suppose to be due to nature or chance; t", "output": "is not in human nature to do this. But they do so with those whom they think to be the authors of their own misfortunes; and this they do from a conviction that the man who has not this virtue is not a member of the state, but is a pestilence or a wild beast, and may be destroyed. And this is the reason of their conduct. And I think that I have now made out that the Athenians are right in admitting every man as a counsellor about justice and honesty, and in punishing those who are not good, and in giving rewards", "target": null}, {"prompt": "hey do not try to punish or to prevent them from being what they are; they do but pity them. Who is so foolish as to chastise or instruct the ugly, or the diminutive, or the feeble? And for this reason. Because he knows that good and evil of this kind is the work of nature and of chance; whereas if a man is wanting in those good qualities which are attained by study and exercise and teaching,\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand has only the contrary evil qualities, other men are angry with him, and punish and reprove him\u2014of these evil qualities one is impiety, another injustice, and they may be described generally as the very opposite of political virtue. In such cases any man will be angry with another, and reprimand him,\u2014clearly because he thinks that by study and learning, the virtue in which the other is deficient may be acquired. If you will think, Socrates, of the nature of punishment, you will see at once that in the opinion of mankind virtue may be acquired; no one punishes the evil\u2013doer under the notion, or for the reason, that he has done wrong,\u2014only the unreasonable fury of a beast acts in that manner. But he who desires to inflict rational punishment does not retaliate for a past wrong which cannot be undone; he has regard to the future, and is desirous that the man who is\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpunished, and he who sees him punished, may be deterred from doing wrong again. He punishes for the sake of prevention, thereby clearly implying that virtue is capable of being taught. This is the notion of all who retaliate upon others either privately or publicly. And the Athenians, too, your own citizens, like other men, punish and take vengeance on all whom they regard as evil doers; and hence, we may infer them to be of the number of those who think that virtue may be acquired and taught.

For we have shown that they think virtue capable of being taught and cultivated both in private and public; and, notwithstanding, they have their sons taught lesser matters, ignorance of which does not involve the punishment of death: but greater things, of which the ignorance may cause death and exile to those who have no training or knowledge of them\u2014aye, and confiscation as well as death, and, in a word, may be the ruin of\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfamilies\u2014those things, I say, they are supposed not to teach them,\u2014not to take the utmost care that they should learn. How improbable is this, Socrates!They do in fact teach them in all stages of their life by the help of tutors, nurses, teachers, and professors of all sorts.When they grow up the laws become their teacher. Beyond question, then, virtue can be taught.Education and admonition commence in the first years of childhood, and last to the very end of life. Mother and nurse and father and tutor are vying with one another about the improvement of the child as soon as ever he is able to understand what is being said to him: he cannot say or do anything without their setting forth to him that this is just and that is unjust; this is honourable, that is dishonourable; this is holy, that is unholy; do this and abstain from that. And if he obeys, well and good; if not, he is straightened by threats and blows, like a piece of bent or warped wood. At a later stage they send him to teachers, and enjoin them to see to his manners even more than to his reading and music; and the teachers do as they are desired. And when the boy has learned his letters and is beginning to understand what is written, as before he understood only what was spoken, they put into his hands the works of great poets, which he reads sitting on a bench at school; in these are contained many admonitions, and many tales, and praises, and encomia of ancient famous men, which he is required to learn by heart, in order that he may imitate or emulate them and desire to become like them. Then, again, the teachers of the lyre take similar care that their young disciple is temperate and gets into no mischief; and when they have taught him the use of the lyre, they introduce him to the poems of other excellent poets, who are the lyric poets; and these they set to music, and make their harmonies and rhythms quite familiar to the children\u2019s souls, in order that they may learn to be more gentle, and harmonious, and rhythmical, and so more fitted for speech and action; for the life of man in every part has need of harmony and rhythm. Then they send them to the master\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof gymnastic, in order that their bodies may better minister to the virtuous mind, and that they may not be compelled through bodily weakness to play the coward in war or on any other occasion. This is what is done by those who have the means, and those who have the means are the rich; their children begin to go to school soonest and leave off latest. When they have done with masters, the state again compels them to learn the laws, and live after the pattern which they furnish, and not after their own fancies; and just as in learning to write, the writing\u2013master first draws lines with a style for the use of the young beginner, and gives him the tablet and makes him follow the lines, so the city draws the laws, which were the invention of good lawgivers living in the olden time; these are given to the young man, in order to guide him in his conduct whether he is commanding or obeying; ", "output": "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand he must not follow his own fancies, but the laws, which are the lines of the writing\u2013master.

And this is what the good man has done with his son,\u2014he has made him a citizen of the state, and has entrusted him to the state, to be educated and trained in the laws and the laws only.

Now when there is all this care about virtue private and public, why, Socrates, do you still wonder and doubt whether virtue can be taught? Cease to wonder, for the opposite would be far more surprising.But the sons of good men are not always good men, any more than the sons of good artists are always good artists.The worst of civilized men are good enough compared with savages.All men are teachers of virtue to a certain extent.But why then do the sons of good fathers often turn out ill? There is nothing very wonderful in this; for, as I have been saying, the existence of a state implies that virtue is not any man\u2019s private possession. If so\u2014and nothing can be truer\u2014then I will further ask you to imagine, as an illustration, some other pursuit or branch of knowledge which may be assumed equally to be the condition of the existence of a state. Suppose that there could be no state unless we were all flute\u2013players, as far as each had the capacity, and everybody was freely teaching everybody the art, both in private and public, and reproving the bad player as freely and openly as every man now teaches justice and the laws, not concealing them as he would conceal the other arts, but imparting them\u2014for all of us have a mutual interest\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the justice and virtue of one another, and this is the reason why every one is so ready to teach justice and the laws;\u2014suppose, I say, that there were the same readiness and liberality among us in teaching one another flute\u2013playing, do you imagine, Socrates, that the sons of good flute\u2013players would be more likely to be good than the sons of bad ones? I think not. Would not their sons grow up to be distinguished or undistinguished according to their own natural capacities as flute\u2013players, and the son of a good player would often turn out to be a bad one, and the son of a bad player to be a good one, and all flute\u2013players would be good enough in comparison of those who were ignorant and unacquainted with the art of flute\u2013playing? In like manner I would have you consider that he who appears to you to be the worst of those who have been brought up in laws and humanities, would appear to be a just\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tman and a master of justice if he were to be compared with men who had no education, or courts of justice, or laws, or any restraints upon them which compelled them to practise virtue\u2014with the savages, for example, whom the poet Pherecrates exhibited on the stage at the last year\u2019s Lenaean festival. If you were living among men such as the manhaters in his Chorus, you would be only too glad to meet with Eurybates and Phrynondas, and you would sorrowfully long to revisit the rascality of this part of the world. And you, Socrates, are discontented, and why? Because all men are teachers of virtue, each one according to his ability; and you say Where are the teachers? You might as well ask, Who teaches Greek? For of that too there will not be any teachers found. Or you might ask, Who is to teach the sons of our artisans this same art which they have learned of their\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfathers? He and his fellow\u2013workmen have taught them to the best of their ability,\u2014but who will carry them further in their arts? And you would certainly have a difficulty, Socrates, in finding a teacher of them; but there would be no difficulty in finding a teacher of those who are wholly ignorant. And this is true of virtue or of anything else; if a man is better able than we are to promote virtue ever so little, we must be content with the result. A teacher of this sort I believe myself to be, and above all other men to have the knowledge which makes a man noble and good; and I give my pupils their money\u2019s\u2013worth, and even more, as they themselves confess.

I should certainly answer him on my own behalf that justice is holy, and that holiness is just; and I would say in like manner on your behalf also, if you would allow me, that justice is either the same with holiness, or very nearly the same; and above all I would assert that justice is like holiness and holiness is like justice; and I wish that you would tell me whether I may be permitted to give this answer on your behalf, and whether you would agree with me.He replied, I cannot simply agree, Socrates, to the proposition that justice is holy and that holiness is just, for there appears to me to be a difference between them.

Passage: As Protagoras declines to adopt his adversary\u2019s method, Socrates rises to depart,Socrates, he replied, many a battle of words have I fought, and if I had followed the method of disputation which my adversaries desired, as you want me to do, I should have been no better than another, and the name of Protagoras would have been nowhere.I saw that he was not satisfied with his previous answers, and that he would not play the part of answerer any more if he could help; and I considered that there was no call upon me to continue the conversation; so I said: Protagoras, I do not wish to force the conversation upon you if you had rather not, but when you are willing to argue with me in such a way that I can follow you, then I will argue with you. Now you, as is said of you by others and as you say of yourself, are able to have discussions in shorter forms of speech as well as in longer, for you are a master of wisdom; but I cannot manage these long speeches: I only wish that I could. You, on the other hand, who are capable of either, ought to speak shorter as I beg you, and then we might converse. But I see that you are disinclined, and as I have an engagement which will prevent my staying to hear you at greater length (for I have to be in another place), I will depart; although I should have liked\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto have heard you.but is detained by Callias.Thus I spoke, and was rising from my seat, when Callias seized me by the right hand, and in his left hand caught hold of this old cloak of mine. He said: We cannot let you go, Socrates, for if you leave us there will be an end of our discussions: I must therefore beg you to remain, as there is nothing in the world that I should like better than to hear you and Protagoras discourse. Do not deny the company this pleasure.Socrates would be very willing to comply with his wishes if he could.He cannot run, but Protagoras can walk.Now I had got up, and was in the act of departure. Son of Hipponicus, I replied, I have always admired, and do now heartily applaud and love your philosophical spirit, and I would gladly comply with your request, if I could. But the truth is that I cannot. And what you ask is as great an impossibility to me, as if you bade me run a race with Crison of Himera, when in his prime, or with some one of the long or day course runners. To such a request I should reply that I would fain ask the same of my own legs; but they refuse to comply. And therefore if you want to see Crison and me in the same stadium, you must bid him slacken his speed to mine, for I cannot run quickly, and he can run slowly. And in like manner if you want to hear me and Protagoras discoursing, you must ask him to shorten his answers, and keep to the point, as he did\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tat first; if not, how can there be any discussion? For discussion is one thing, and making an oration is quite another, in my humble opinion.Yet Protagoras may claim to speak in his own manner.Not so, says Alcibiades, unless he will admit his inferiority to Socrates in the shorter method.But you see, Socrates, said Callias, that Protagoras may fairly claim to speak in his own way, just as you claim to speak in yours.Here Alcibiades interposed, and said: That, Callias, is not a true statement of the case. For our friend Socrates admits that he cannot make a speech\u2014in this he yields the palm to Protagoras: but I should be greatly surprised if he yielded to any living man in the power of holding and apprehending an argument. Now if Protagoras will make a similar admission, and confess that he is inferior to Socrates in argumentative skill, that is enough for Socrates; but if he claims a superiority in argument as well, let him ask and answer\u2014not, when a question is asked, slipping away from the point, and instead of answering, making a speech at such length that most of his hearers forget the question at issue (not that Socrates is likely to forget\u2014I will be bound for that, although he may pretend in fun that he has a bad memory). And Socrates appears to", "output": "me to be quite right in saying that he cannot make a speech: and Protagoras is not wrong in saying that he cannot argue, for he cannot. But to say that he cannot argue, and to say that he can make a speech, are two very different things. And Socrates, if he had not a bad memory, would never forget the question at issue, and would always be able to answer.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI know, said Protagoras, that I am not able to make a speech, and that I am not able to argue; but I do not admit that", "target": null}, {"prompt": " me to be more in the right than Protagoras; that is my view, and every man ought to say\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhat he thinks.Critias attempts to reconcile Protagoras and Socrates.When Alcibiades had done speaking, some one\u2014Critias, I believe\u2014went on to say: O Prodicus and Hippias, Callias appears to me to be a partisan of Protagoras: and this led Alcibiades, who loves opposition, to take the other side. But we should not be partisans either of Socrates or of Protagoras; let us rather unite in entreating both of them not to break up the discussion.Prodicus in a balanced form of words advocates impartiality.Prodicus added: That, Critias, seems to me to be well said, for those who are present at such discussions ought to be impartial hearers of both the speakers; remembering, however, that impartiality is not the same as equality, for both sides should be impartially heard, and yet an equal meed should not be assigned to both of them; but to the wiser a higher meed should be given, and a lower to the less wise. And I as well as Critias would beg you, Protagoras and Socrates, to grant our request, which is, that you will argue with one another and not wrangle; for friends argue with friends out of good\u2013will, but only adversaries and enemies wrangle. And then our meeting will be delightful; for in this way you, who are the speakers, will be most likely to win esteem, and not praise only, among us who are your audience; for esteem is a sincere conviction of the hearers\u2019\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsouls, but praise is often an insincere expression of men uttering falsehoods contrary to their conviction. And thus we who are the hearers will be gratified and not pleased; for gratification is of the mind when receiving wisdom and knowledge, but pleasure is of the body when eating or experiencing some other bodily delight. Thus spoke Prodicus, and many of the company applauded his words.Hippias, in a sententious speech, advocates the appointment of an arbiter.Hippias the sage spoke next. He said: All of you who are here present I reckon to be kinsmen and friends and fellow\u2013citizens, by nature and not by law; for by nature like is akin to like, whereas law is the tyrant of mankind, and often compels us to do many things which are against nature. How great would be the disgrace then, if we, who know the nature of things, and are the wisest of the Hellenes, and as such are met together in this city, which is the metropolis of wisdom, and in the greatest and most glorious house of this city, should have nothing to show worthy of this height of dignity, but should only quarrel with one another like the meanest of mankind! I do pray and advise you, Protagoras, and you, Socrates, to agree upon a compromise. Let us be your peacemakers. And do not you, Socrates, aim at this precise and extreme brevity in discourse, if Protagoras objects, but loosen and let go\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe reins of speech, that your words may be grander and more becoming to you1. Neither do you, Protagoras, go forth on the gale with every sail set out of sight of land into an ocean of words, but let there be a mean observed by both of you. Do as I say. And let me also persuade you to choose an arbiter or overseer or president; he will keep watch over your words and will prescribe their proper length.But there can be no arbiter superior to Protagoras, and therefore Socrates suggests that Protagoras shall ask, and he will answer; and when he is tired of asking, Socrates will ask and Protagoras shall answer.This proposal was received by the company with universal approval; Callias said that he would not let me off, and they begged me to choose an arbiter. But I said that to choose an umpire of discourse would be unseemly; for if the person chosen was inferior, then the inferior or worse ought not to preside over the better; or if he was equal, neither would that be well; for he who is our equal will do as we do, and what will be the use of choosing him?

I dare say that Prodicus and many others would say, as Hesiod says,\u2018On the one hand, hardly can a man become good,For the gods have made virtue the reward of toil;But on the other hand, when you have climbed the height,Then, to retain virtue, however difficult the acquisition, is easy2.\u2019Simonides could never have meant to say that virtue can be easily possessed.Prodicus heard and approved; but Protagoras said: Your correction, Socrates, involves a greater error than is contained in the sentence which you are correcting.Alas! I said, Protagoras; then I am a sorry physician, and do but aggravate a disorder which I am seeking to cure.Such is the fact, he said.How so? I asked.The poet, he replied, could never have made such a mistake as to say that virtue, which in the opinion of all men is the hardest of all things, can be easily retained.Socrates has learned from Prodicus that \u2018hard\u2019 means \u2018evil.\u2019Well, I said, and how fortunate are we in having Prodicus among us, at the right moment; for he has a wisdom, Protagoras, which, as I imagine, is more than human and of very ancient date, and may be as old as Simonides or even older. Learned as you are in many things, you appear to know nothing of this; but I know, for I am a disciple of his. And now, if I am not mistaken, you do not understand the word \u2018hard\u2019 (\u03c7\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u03c0\u03cc\u03bd) in the sense which Simonides intended; and I must correct you, as Prodicus corrects me when I use the word \u2018awful\u2019 (\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03bd) as a term of praise. If I say that Protagoras or any one else is an \u2018awfully\u2019 wise man, he asks me if I am not\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tashamed of calling that which is good \u2018awful\u2019; and then he explains to me that the term \u2018awful\u2019 is always taken in a bad sense, and that no one speaks of being \u2018awfully\u2019 healthy or wealthy, or of \u2018awful\u2019 peace, but of \u2018awful\u2019 disease, \u2018awful\u2019 war, \u2018awful\u2019 poverty, meaning by the term \u2018awful,\u2019 evil.

Passage: \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twill be the listener.To this proposal Protagoras replied: As you please;\u2014and Hippias, Prodicus, and the others told me by all means to do as I proposed.The true ancient philosophy is to be found, not in the long discourses of the Sophists,but in the pregnant brevity of the Lacedaemonians.Then now, I said, I will endeavour to explain to you my opinion about this poem of Simonides. There is a very ancient philosophy which is more cultivated in Crete and Lacedaemon than in any other part of Hellas, and there are more philosophers in those countries than anywhere else in the world. This, however, is a secret which the Lacedaemonians deny; and they pretend to be ignorant, just because they do not wish to have it thought that they rule the world by wisdom, like the Sophists of whom Protagoras was speaking, and not by valour of arms; considering that if the reason of their superiority were disclosed, all men would be practising their wisdom. And this secret of theirs has never been discovered by the imitators of Lacedaemonian fashions in other cities, who go about with their ears bruised in imitation of them, and have the caestus bound on their arms, and are always in training, and wear short cloaks;\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor they imagine that these are the practices which have enabled the Lacedaemonians to conquer the other Hellenes. Now when the Lacedaemonians want to unbend and hold free conversation with their wise men, and are no longer satisfied with mere secret intercourse, they drive out all these laconizers, and any other foreigners who may happen to be in their country, and they hold a philosophical s\u00e9ance unknown to strangers; and they themselves forbid their young men to go out into other cities\u2014in this they are like the Cretans\u2014in order that they may not unlearn the lessons which they have taught them. And in Lacedaemon and Crete not only men but also women have a pride in their high cultivation. And hereby you may know that I am right in attributing to the Lacedaemonians this excellence in philosophy and speculation: If a man converses with the most ordinary Lacedaemonian, he will find\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thim seldom good for much in general conversation, but at any point in the discourse he will be darting out some notable saying, terse and full of meaning, with unerring aim; and the person with whom he is talking seems to be like a child in his hands. And many of our own age and of former ages have noted that the true Lacedaemonian type of character has the love of philosophy even stronger than the love of gymnastics; they are conscious that only a perfectly educated man is capable of uttering such expressions. Such were Thales of Miletus, and Pittacus of Mitylene, and Bias of Priene, and our own Solon, and Cleobulus the Lindian, and Myson the Chenian; and seventh in the catalogue of wise men was the Lacedaemonian Chilo. All these were lovers and emulators and disciples of the culture of the Lacedaemonians, and any one may perceive that their wisdom was of this character; consisting of short memorable\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsentences, which they severally uttered. And they met together and dedicated in the temple of Apollo at Delphi, as the first\u2013fruits of their wisdom, the far\u2013famed inscriptions, which are in all men\u2019s mouths,\u2014\u2018Know thyself,\u2019 and \u2018Nothing too much.\u2019Why do I say all this? I am explaining that this Lacedaemonian brevity was the style of primitive philosophy. Now there was a saying of Pittacus which was privately circulated and received the approbation of the wise, \u2018Hard is it to be good.\u2019 And Simonides, who was ambitious of the fame of wisdom, was aware that if he could overthrow this saying, then, as if he had won a victory over some famous athlete, he would carry off the palm among his contemporaries. And if I am not mistaken, he composed the entire poem with the secret intention of damaging Pittacus and his saying.Let us all unite in examining his words, and see whether I am speaking the truth. Simonides must have been a lunatic, if, in the very first w", "output": "aking moment of his soul, he could not have perceived that he was setting himself to do a thing which was impossible, and which no one could accomplish.

And the truth is that no one can be good, if he is a man, but he must be good, and that is all; and if he is not good, he is bad, and that is all.

Pittacus is saying \u2018Hard is it to be good,\u2019 and he, in refutation of this thesis, rejoins that the truly hard thing, Pittacus, is to become good, not joining \u2018truly\u2019 with \u2018good,\u2019 but with \u2018hard.\u2019 Not, that the hard thing is to be truly good, as though there were some truly good men, and there were others who were good but not\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttruly good (this would be a very simple observation, and quite unworthy of Simonides); but you must suppose him to make a trajection of the word \u2018truly\u2019 (\u1f00\u03bb\u03b1\u03b8\u03ad\u03c9\u03c2), construing the saying of Pittacus thus (and let us imagine Pittacus to be speaking and Simonides answering him): \u2018O my friends,\u2019 says Pittacus, \u2018hard is it to be good,\u2019 and Simonides answers, \u2018In that, Pittacus, you are mistaken; the difficulty is not to be good, but on the one hand, to become good, four\u2013square in hands and feet and mind, without a flaw\u2014that is hard truly.\u2019 This way of reading the passage accounts for the insertion of \u03bc\u03ad\u03bd, \u2018on the one hand,\u2019 and for the position at the end of the clause of the word \u2018truly,\u2019 and all that\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfollows shows this to be the meaning. A great deal might be said in praise of the details of the poem, which is a charming piece of workmanship, and very finished, but such minutiae would be tedious. I should like, however, to point out the general intention of the poem, which is certainly designed in every part to be a refutation of the saying of Pittacus. For he speaks in what follows a little further on as if he meant to argue that although there is a difficulty in becoming good, yet this is possible for a time, and only for a time. But having become good, to remain in a good state and be good, as you, Pittacus, affirm, is not possible, and is not granted to man; God only has this blessing; \u2018but man cannot help being bad when the force of circumstances overpowers him.\u2019 Now whom does the force of circumstance overpower in the command of a vessel?\u2014not the private individual, for he is always\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\toverpowered; and as one who is already prostrate cannot be overthrown, and only he who is standing upright but not he who is prostrate can be laid prostrate, so the force of circumstances can only overpower him who, at some time or other, has resources, and not him who is at all times helpless. The descent of a great storm may make the pilot helpless, or the severity of the season the husbandman or the physician; for the good may become bad, as another poet witnesses:\u2014\u2018The good are sometimes good and sometimes bad.\u2019But the bad does not become bad; he is always bad. So that when the force of circumstances overpowers the man of resources and skill and virtue, then he cannot help being bad. And you, Pittacus, are saying, \u2018Hard is it to be good.\u2019 Now there is a difficulty in becoming good; and yet this is possible: but to be good is an impossibility\u2014\u2018For he who does well is the good man, and he who does ill is the bad.\u2019But what sort of doing is good in letters? and what sort of doing makes a man good in letters? Clearly the knowing of them. And what sort of well\u2013doing makes a man a good physician? Clearly the knowledge of the art of healing the sick. \u2018But he who does ill is the bad.\u2019 Now who becomes a bad physician? Clearly he who is in the first place a physician, and in the second place a good physician; for he may become a bad one also: but none of us unskilled individuals can by any amount of doing ill become physicians, any more than we can become carpenters or anything of that sort; and he who by doing ill cannot become a physician at all, clearly cannot become a bad physician. In like manner the good may become deteriorated by time, or toil, or disease, or other accident (the only real doing ill is to be deprived of knowledge), but the bad man will never become bad, for he\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis always bad; and if he were to beco", "output": "e good, he would no longer be bad.

For he who is good remains good, and he who is bad remains bad, but he who is good becomes bad.

Thus the words of the poem tend to show that on the one hand a man cannot be continuously good, but that he may become good and may also become bad; and again that\u2018They are the best for the longest time whom the gods love.\u2019Socrates proposes an explanation, ingenious rather than true, of the verses of Simonides.He seems to be adopting the Sophists\u2019 arts of interpretation.Socrates by the help of logic and rhetoric strives to elicit the meaning of Simonides.All this relates to Pittacus, as is further proved by the sequel. For he adds:\u2014\u2018Therefore I will not throw away my span of life to no purpose in searching after the impossible, hoping in vain to find a perfectly faultless man among those who partake of the fruit of the broad\u2013bosomed earth: if I find him, I will send you word.\u2019(this is the vehement way in which he pursues his attack upon Pittacus throughout the whole poem):\u2018But him who does no evil, voluntarily I praise and love;\u2014not even the gods war against necessity.\u2019All this has a similar drift, for Simonides was not so ignorant as to say that he praised those who did no evil voluntarily, as though there were some who did evil voluntarily. For no wise man, as I believe, will allow that any human being errs voluntarily, or voluntarily does evil and dishonourable actions; but they are very well aware that all who do evil and dishonourable things do them against their will. And Simonides never says that he praises him who does no evil voluntarily; the word \u2018voluntarily\u2019 applies to himself. For he was under the impression that a good man might often compel himself to love and praise another1, and to be the friend and approver of another; and that there might be an involuntary love, such as a man might feel to an unnatural father or mother, or country, or the like. Now bad men, when their parents or country have any defects, look on them with malignant joy, and find fault with them and expose and denounce them to others, under the idea that the rest of mankind will be less likely to take themselves to task and accuse them of neglect; and they blame their defects far more than they deserve, in order that the odium which is necessarily incurred by them may be increased: but the good man dissembles his feelings, and constrains himself to praise them; and if they have wronged him and he is angry, he pacifies his anger and is reconciled, and compels himself to love and praise his own flesh and blood. And Simonides, as is probable, considered that he himself had often had to praise and magnify a tyrant or the like, much against his will, and he\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\talso wishes to imply to Pittacus that he does not censure him because he is censorious.\u2018For I am satisfied,\u2019 he says, \u2018when a man is neither bad nor very stupid; and when he knows justice (which is the health of states), and is of sound mind, I will find no fault with him, for I am not given to finding fault, and there are innumerable fools\u2019(implying that if he delighted in censure he might have abundant opportunity of finding fault).\u2018All things are good with which evil is unmingled.\u2019In these latter words he does not mean to say that all things are good which have no evil in them, as you might say \u2018All things are white which have no black in them,\u2019 for that would be ridiculous; but he means to say that he accepts and finds no fault with the moderate or intermediate state.[\u2018I do not hope,\u2019 he says, \u2018to find a perfectly blameless man among those who partake of the fruits of the broad\u2013bosomed earth (if I find him, I will send you word); in this sense I praise no man. But he who is moderately good, and does no evil, is good enough for me, who love and approve every one\u2019](and here observe that he uses a Lesbian word, \u1f10\u03c0\u03b1\u1f76\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9 (approve), because he is addressing Pittacus,\u2014\u2018Who love and approve every one voluntarily, who does no evil:\u2019The entire poem is really a polemic against Pittacus.and that the stop should be put after \u2018voluntarily\u2019); \u2018but there are some whom I involuntarily praise and love.

At present we must abide by the compact which was made between Socrates and Protagoras, to the effect that as long as Protagoras is willing to ask, Socrates should answer; or that if he would rather answer, then that Socrates should ask.He is prevented from interrupting by Alcibiades. Socrates would rather have done with the poets and return to the argument.I said: I wish Protagoras either to ask or answer as he is inclined; but I would rather have done with poems and odes, if he does not object, and come back to the question about which I was asking you at first, Protagoras, and by your help make an end of that. The talk about the poets seems to me like a commonplace entertainment to which a vulgar company have recourse; who, because they are not able to converse or amuse one another, while they are drinking, with the sound of their own voices and conversation, by reason of their stupidity, raise the price of flute\u2013girls in the market, hiring for a great sum the voice of a flute instead of their own breath, to be the medium of intercourse among them: but where the company are real gentlemen and men of education, you will see no flute\u2013girls, nor dancing\u2013girls, nor harp\u2013girls; and they have no\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnonsense or games, but are contented with one another\u2019s conversation, of which their own voices are the medium, and which they carry on by turns and in an orderly manner, even though they are very liberal in their potations. And a company like this of ours, and men such as we profess to be, do not require the help of another\u2019s voice, or of the poets whom you cannot interrogate about the meaning of what they are saying; people who cite them declaring, some that the poet has one meaning, and others that he has another, and the point which is in dispute can never be decided. This sort of entertainment they decline, and prefer to talk with one another, and put one another to the proof in conversation. And these are the models which I desire that you and I should imitate. Leaving the poets, and keeping to ourselves, let us try the mettle of one another and make proof of the truth in\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconversation. If you have a mind to ask, I am ready to answer; or if you would rather, do you answer, and give me the opportunity of resuming and completing our unfinished argument.I made these and some similar observations; but Protagoras would not distinctly say which he would do. Thereupon Alcibiades turned to Callias, and said:\u2014Do you think, Callias, that Protagoras is fair in refusing to say whether he will or will not answer? for I certainly think that he is unfair; he ought either to proceed with the argument, or distinctly to refuse to proceed, that we may know his intention; and then Socrates will be able to discourse with some one else, and the rest of the company will be free to talk with one another.Protagoras is compelled to resume the argument.I think that Protagoras was really made ashamed by these words of Alcibiades, and when the prayers of Callias and the company were superadded, he was at last induced to argue, and said that I might ask and he would answer.So I said: Do not imagine, Protagoras, that I have any other interest in asking questions of you but that of clearing up my own difficulties. For I think that Homer was very right in saying that\u2018When two go together, one sees before the other1,\u2019for all men who have a companion are readier in deed, word, or thought; but if a man\u2018Sees a thing when he is alone,\u2019Half ir", "output": "rational, half mad he is.

And I would rather hold discourse with you than with any one, because I think that no man has a better understanding of most things which a good man may be expected to understand, and in particular of virtue. For who is there, but you?\u2014who not only claim to be a good man and a gentleman, for many are this, and yet have not the power of making others good\u2014whereas you are not only good yourself, but also the cause of goodness in others. Moreover such confidence have you in yourself, that although other Sophists conceal their profession, you proclaim in the face of Hellas that you are a Sophist or teacher of virtue and education, and are the first who demanded pay in return. How then can I do otherwise than invite you to the examination of these subjects, and ask questions and consult with you? I must, indeed. And I should like once more to have my memory refreshed by you about the questions which I was asking you at first, and also to have your help in considering them. If I am not mistaken the question was this: Are wisdom and temperance and courage and justice and holiness five names of the same thing? or has each of the names a separate underlying essence and corresponding thing having a peculiar function, no one of them being like any other of them? And you replied that the five names were not the names of the same thing, but that each of them had a separate object, and that all these objects were parts of virtue, not in the same way that the parts of gold are like each other and the whole of which they are parts, but as the parts of the face are unlike the whole of which they are parts and one another, and have each of\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthem a distinct function. I should like to know whether this is still your opinion; or if not, I will ask you to define your meaning, and I shall not take you to task if you now make a different statement. For I dare say that you may have said what you did only in order to make trial of me.I answer, Socrates, he said, that all these qualities are parts of virtue, and that four out of the five are to some extent similar, and that the fifth of them, which is courage, is very different from the other four, as I prove in this way: You may observe that many men are utterly unrighteous, unholy, intemperate, ignorant, who are nevertheless remarkable for their courage.And the courageous are the confident; but not all the confident are truly courageous.Stop, I said; I should like to think about that.", "output": "And I will do so.

When you asked me, I certainly did say that the courageous are the confident; but I was never asked whether the confident are the courageous; if you had asked me, I should have answered \u2018Not all of them:\u2019 and what I did answer you have not proved to be false, although you proceeded to show that those who have knowledge are more courageous than they were before they had knowledge, and more courageous than others who have no knowledge, and were then led on to think that courage is the same as wisdom. But in this way of arguing you might come to imagine that strength is wisdom. You might begin by asking whether the strong are able, and I should say \u2018Yes;\u2019 and then whether those who know how to wrestle are not more able to wrestle than those who do not know how to wrestle, and more able\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tafter than before they had learned, and I should assent.

Passage: \u2018And do you not pursue after pleasure as a good, and avoid pain as an evil?\u2019He assented.Pain is an evil and pleasure is a good:\u2018Then you think that pain is an evil and pleasure is a good: and even pleasure you deem an evil, when it robs you of greater pleasures than it gives, or causes pains greater than the pleasure. If, however, you call pleasure an evil in relation to some other end or standard, you will be able to show us that standard. But you have none to show.\u2019I do not think that they have, said Protagoras.but pain is also a good when it takes away a greater pain.\u2018And have you not a similar way of speaking about pain? You call pain a good when it takes away greater pains than those which it has, or gives pleasures greater than the pains: then if you have some standard other than pleasure and pain to which you refer when you call actual pain a good, you can show what that is. But you cannot.\u2019True, said Protagoras.When we say of a man that he is overcome by pleasure we only mean that he is overcome by a lesser pleasure.Whether we speak of pleasure and pain, or of good and evil, the result is the same.Suppose again, I said, that the world says to me: \u2018Why do you spend many words and speak in many ways on this subject?\u2019 Excuse me, friends, I should reply; but in the first place there is a difficulty in explaining the meaning of the expression \u2018overcome by pleasure;\u2019 and the whole argument turns upon this. And even now, if you see any possible way in which evil can be explained as other than pain, or good as other than pleasure, you may still retract. Are you satisfied, then, at having a life of pleasure which is without pain? If you are, and if you are unable to show any good or evil which does not end in pleasure and pain, hear the consequences:\u2014If what you say is true, then the argument is absurd which affirms that a man often does evil knowingly, when he might abstain, because he is seduced and\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\toverpowered by pleasure; or again, when you say that a man knowingly refuses to do what is good because he is overcome at the moment by pleasure. And that this is ridiculous will be evident if only we give up the use of various names, such as pleasant and painful, and good and evil. As there are two things, let us call them by two names\u2014first, good and evil, and then pleasant and painful. Assuming this, let us go on to say that a man does evil knowing that he does evil. But some one will ask, Why? Because he is overcome, is the first answer. And by what is he overcome? the enquirer will proceed to ask. And we shall not be able to reply \u2018By pleasure,\u2019 for the name of pleasure has been exchanged for that of good. In our answer, then, we shall only say that he is overcome. \u2018By what?\u2019 he will reiterate. By the good, we shall have to reply; indeed we shall. Nay, but our questioner will\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trejoin with a laugh, if he be one of the swaggering sort, \u2018That is too ridiculous, that a man should do what he knows to be evil when he ought not, because he is overcome by good. Is that, he will ask, because the good was worthy or not worthy of conquering the evil\u2019? And in answer to that we shall clearly reply, Because it was not worthy; for if it had been worthy, then he who, as we say, was overcome by pleasure, would not have been wrong. \u2018But how,\u2019 he will reply, \u2018can the good be unworthy of the evil, or the evil of the good\u2019? Is not the real explanation that they are out of proportion to one another, either as greater and smaller, or more and fewer? This we cannot deny. And when you speak of being overcome\u2014\u2018what do you mean,\u2019 he will say, \u2018but that you choose the greater evil in exchange for the lesser good\u2019? Admitted.

There can be no other measure of them. And do you, like a skilful weigher, put into the balance the pleasures and the pains, and their nearness and distance, and weigh them, and then say which outweighs the other. If you weigh pleasures against pleasures, you of course take the more and\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgreater; or if you weigh pains against pains, you take the fewer and the less; or if pleasures against pains, then you choose that course of action in which the painful is exceeded by the pleasant, whether the distant by the near or the near by the distant; and you avoid that course of action in which the pleasant is exceeded by the painful.

He said: You will find, Socrates, that some of the most impious, and unrighteous, and intemperate, and ignorant of men are among the most courageous; which proves that courage is very different from the other parts of virtue. I was surprised at his saying this at the time, and I am still more surprised now that I have discussed the matter\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith you. So I asked him whether by the brave he meant the confident. Yes, he replied, and the impetuous or goers. (You may remember, Protagoras, that this was your answer.)He assented.

They have somehow both of them changed their position in the course of the argument.My only object, I said, in continuing the discussion, has been the desire to ascertain the nature and relations of virtue; for if this were clear, I am very sure that the other controversy which has been carried on at great length by both of us\u2014you affirming and I denying that virtue can be taught\u2014would also become clear. The result of our discussion appears to me to be singular. For if the argument had a human voice, that voice would be heard laughing at us and saying: \u2018Protagoras and Socrates, you are strange beings; there are you, Socrates, who were saying that virtue cannot be taught, contradicting yourself now by your attempt to prove that all things are knowledge, including justice, and temperance, and courage,\u2014which tends to show that virtue can certainly be taught; for if virtue\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twere other than knowledge, as Protagoras attempted to prove, then clearly virtue cannot be taught; but if virtue is entirely knowledge, as you are seeking to show, then I cannot but suppose that virtue is capable of being taught. Protagoras, on the other hand, who started by saying that it might be taught, is now eager to prove it to be anything rather than knowledge; and if this is true, it must be quite incapable of being taught.\u2019 Now I, Protagoras, perceiving this terrible confusion of our ideas, have a great desire that they should be cleared up. And I should like to carry on the discussion until we ascertain what virtue is, and whether capable of being taught or not, lest haply Epimetheus should trip us up and deceive us in the argument, as he forgot us in the story; I prefer your Prometheus to your Epimetheus, for of him I make use, whenever I am busy about these questions, in Promethean care of my own life. And if you have no objection, as I\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsaid at first, I should like to have your help in the enquiry.Protagoras replied: Socrates, I am not of a base nature, and I am the last man in the world to be envious. I cannot but applaud your energy and your conduct of an argument. As I have often said, I admire you above all men whom I know, and far above all men of your age; and I believe that you will become very eminent in philosophy. Let us come back to the subject at some future time; at present we had better turn to something else.By all means, I said, if that is your wish; for I too ought long since to have kept the engagement of which I spoke before, and only tarried because I could not refuse the request of the noble Callias.
