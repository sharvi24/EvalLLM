[{"prompt": "context:  Euthydemus.\nIntroduction.\n\nThe Euthydemus, though apt to be regarded by us only as an elaborate jest, has also a very serious purpose. It may fairly claim to be the oldest treatise on logic; for that science originates in the misunderstandings which necessarily accompany the first efforts of speculation. Several of the fallacies which are satirized in it reappear in the Sophistici Elenchi of Aristotle and are retained at the end of our manuals of logic. But if the order of history were followed, they should be placed not at the end but at the beginning of them; for they belong to the age in which the human mind was first making the attempt to distinguish thought from sense, and to separate the universal from the particular or individual.

The intellectual world has become better assured to us, and we are less likely to be imposed upon by illusions of words.\nThe logic of Aristotle is for the most part latent in the dialogues of Plato.

Here we have most of the important elements of logic, not yet systematized or reduced to an art or science, but scattered up and down as they would naturally occur in ordinary discourse. They are of little or no use or significance to us; but because we have grown out of the need of them we should not therefore despise them.

Neither do we discuss the nature of the proposition, nor extract hidden truths from the copula, nor dispute any longer about nominalism and realism. We do not confuse the form with the matter of knowledge, or invent laws of thought, or imagine that any single science furnishes a principle of reasoning to all the rest.

The performance begins; and such a performance as might well seem to require an invocation of Memory and the Muses. It is agreed that the brothers shall question Cleinias. \u2018Cleinias,\u2019 says Euthydemus, \u2018who learn, the wise or the unwise?\u2019 \u2018The wise,\u2019 is the reply; given with blushing and hesitation. \u2018And yet when you learned you did not know and were not wise.\u2019 Then Dionysodorus takes up the ball: \u2018Who are they who learn dictation of the grammar\u2013master; the wise boys or the foolish boys?\u2019 \u2018The wise.\u2019 \u2018Then, after all, the wise learn.\u2019 \u2018And do they learn,\u2019 said Euthydemus, \u2018what they know or what they do not know?\u2019 \u2018The latter.\u2019 \u2018And dictation is a dictation of letters?", "output": "\u2019 \u2018It is.\u2019 \u2018Then the wise are learning what they do not know?\u2019 \u2018They are.\u2019 \u2018And what is the same as what is different?\u2019 \u2018They are not.\u2019 \u2018But they are.\u2019 \u2018What is the same as what is different?\u2019 \u2018They are not.\u2019 \u2018And they are.\u2019 \u2018What is the same as what is different?\u2019 \u2018They are not.\u2019 \u2018And they are.\u2019 \u2018What is the same as what is different?\u2019 \u2018They are not.\u2019 \u2018And they are.\u2019 \u2018What is the same as what is different?\u2019 \u2018They are not.\u2019 \u2018And they are.\u2019", "target": null}, {"prompt": "\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018And you know letters?\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018Then you learn what you know.\u2019 \u2018But,\u2019 retorts Dionysodorus, \u2018is not learning acquiring knowledge?\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018And you acquire that which you have not got already?\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018Then you learn that which you do not know.\u2019\nSocrates is afraid that the youth Cleinias may be discouraged at these repeated overthrows. He therefore explains to him the nature of the process to which he is being subjected. The two strangers are not serious; there are jests at the mysteries which precede the enthronement, and he is being initiated into the mysteries of the sophistical ritual. This is all a sort of horse\u2013play, which is now ended. The exhortation to virtue will follow, and Socrates himself (if the wise men will not laugh at him) is desirous of showing the way in which such an exhortation should be carried on, according to his own poor notion.

And again, the possession of goods is not enough; there must also be a right use of them which can only be given by knowledge: in themselves they are neither good nor evil\u2014knowledge and wisdom are the only good, and ignorance and folly the only evil. The conclusion is that we must get \u2018wisdom.\u2019 But can wisdom be taught? \u2018Yes,\u2019 says Cleinias. The ingenuousness of the youth delights Socrates, who is at once relieved from the necessity of discussing one of his great puzzles. \u2018Since wisdom is the only good, he must become a philosopher, or lover of wisdom.\u2019 \u2018That I will,\u2019 says Cleinias.\nAfter Socrates has given this specimen of his own mode of instruction, the two brothers rec", "output": "ount their experience of the famous Sophist Protagoras, who had just been at Athens.

Socrates consoles him with the remark that the good in all professions are few, and recommends that \u2018he and his house\u2019 should continue to serve philosophy, and not mind about its professors.\n\nIntroduction.\n\nThere is a stage in the history of philosophy in which the old is dying out, an", "output": "age of transition in which the new has not yet come to birth.

Great philosophies like the Eleatic or Heraclitean, which have enlarged the boundaries of the human mind, begin to pass away in words. They subsist only as forms which have rooted themselves in language\u2014as troublesome elements of thought which cannot be either used or explained away. The same absoluteness which was once attributed to abstractions is now attached to the words which are the signs of them. The philosophy which in the first and second generation was a great and inspiring effort of reflection, in the third becomes sophistical, verbal, eristic.\nIt is this stage of philosophy which Plato satirises in the Euthydemus. The fallacies which are noted by him appear trifling to us now, but they were not trifling in the age before logic, in the decline of the earlier Greek philosophies, at a time when language was first beginning to perplex human thought.

They are patent to us in Plato, and we are inclined to wonder how any one could ever have been deceived by them; but we must remember also that there was a time when the human mind was only with great difficulty disentangled from such fallacies.\nTo appreciate fully the drift of the Euthydemus, we should imagine a mental state in which not individuals only, but whole schools during more than one generation, were animated by the desire to exclude the conception of rest, and therefore the very word \u2018this\u2019 (Theaet. 183 C) from language; in which the ideas of space, time, matter, motion, were proved to be contradictory and imaginary; in which the nature of qualitative change was a puzzle, and even differences of degree, when applied to abstract notions, were not understood; in which there was no analysis of grammar, and mere puns or plays of words received serious attention; in which contradiction itself was denied, and, on the one hand, every predicate was affirmed to be true of every subject, and", "output": ", on the other hand, the existence of every predicate was denied of every subject. Such a state of mind would be no doubt absurd, but it is not more absurd than that of the Euthydemus.\nIt is not difficult to see why Plato should have chosen the particular form which he did for his satire. In the first place, he must have known that the Euthydemus was a man of considerable power, and that his fame as a dialectician was considerable. He was also a man of some influence, and was in a position to do considerable mischief. He was therefore", "target": null}, {"prompt": " on the other, it was held that no predicate was true of any subject, and that nothing was, or was known, or could be spoken. Let us imagine disputes carried on with religious earnestness and more than scholastic subtlety, in which the catchwords of philosophy are completely detached from their context. (Cp. Theaet. 180.) To such disputes the humour, whether of Plato in the ancient, or of Pope and Swift in the modern world, is the natural enemy. Nor must we forget that in modern times also there is no fallacy so gross, no trick of language so transparent, no abstraction so barren and unmeaning, no form of thought so contradictory to experience, which has not been found to satisfy the minds of philosophical enquirers at a certain stage, or when regarded from a certain point of view only. The peculiarity of the fallacies of our own age is that we live within them, and are therefore generally unconscious of them.\nAristotle has analysed several of the same fallacies in his book \u2018De Sophisticis Elenchis,\u2019 which Pl", "output": "ato himself has treated at some length in the \u2018Republic.\u2019 The most important of these are the fallacies of the \u2018Mistake of the Middle,\u2019 and of the \u2018Mistake of the Minor.\u2019 The first of these fallacies is the most common, and the most easily detected. The form of it is as follows:\u2014A and B are both true, and C is true; therefore A, B, and C are all true. The second is of a different kind, and is more difficult to detect. It is the fallacy of the minor premiss, and is as follows:\u2014A", "target": null}, {"prompt": "ato, with equal command of their true nature, has preferred to bring to the test of ridicule. At first we are only struck with the broad humour of this \u2018reductio ad absurdum:\u2019 gradually we perceive that some important questions begin to emerge. Here, as everywhere else, Plato is making war against the philosophers who put words in the place of things, who tear arguments to tatters, who deny predication, and thus make knowledge impossible; to whom ideas and objects of sense have no fixedness, but are in a state of perpetual oscillation and transition. Two great truths seem to be indirectly taught through these fallacies: (1) The uncertainty of language, which allows the same words to be used in different meanings, or with different degrees of meaning: (2) The necessary limitation or relative nature of all phenomena. Plato is aware that his own doctrine of ideas (p. 301 A), as well as the Eleatic Being and Not\u2013being, alike admit of being regarded as verbal fallacies (p. 284 A, B). The sophism advanced in the Me", "output": "letus is a proof of this.

In contrast with these fallacies is maintained the Socratic doctrine that happiness is gained by knowledge. The grammatical puzzles with which the Dialogue concludes probably contain allusions to tricks of language which may have been practised by the disciples of Prodicus or Antisthenes. They would have had more point, if we were acquainted with the writings against which Plato\u2019s humour is directed. Most of the jests appear to have a serious meaning; but we have lost the clue to some of them, and cannot determine whether, as in the Cratylus, Plato has or has not mixed up purely unmeaning fun with his satire.\nThe two discourses of Socrates may be contrasted in several respects with the exhibition of the Sophists: (1) In their perfect relevancy to", "output": "the subject of the Dialogue. In the Protagoras, the arguments are introduced in a manner which shows that they are in harmony with the general drift of the discussion, and are not introduced for the sake of a display of dialectical skill.

This is a question which will hereafter be answered in the Republic; as the conception of the kingly art (291, 292) is more fully developed in the Politicus, and the caricature of rhetoric (290) in the Gorgias.\nThe characters of the Dialogue are easily intelligible. There is Socrates once more in the character of an old man; and his equal in years, Crito, the father of Critobulus, like Lysimachus in the Laches, his fellow demesman (Apol. 33 D), to whom the scene is narrated, and who once or twice interrupts with a remark after the manner of the interlocutor in the Phaedo, and adds h", "output": "itherto unpublished details, such as the fact that the young men had gone to the Piraeus to meet Socrates, and that they had come back from the Athenian market-place, where they had been buying provisions for the feast.\nThe young men are Phaedo, the friend of Socrates, who is here introduced as a philosopher; and his friend, the orator, Anytus, who is here represented as a Sophist.

Crito will not believe that Socrates has not improved or perhaps invented the answers of Cleinias (cp. Phaedrus, 275 B).

In the Euthydemus the subject is the same as in the Lysis, the subject of the Phaedrus, and the Meno, but is treated in a very different way.

Such a criticism is like similar criticisms on Shakespeare, and proceeds upon a narrow notion of the variety which the Dialogue, like the drama, seems to admit. Plato in the abundance of his dramatic power has chosen to write a play upon a play, just as he often gives us an argument within an argument.

Plato quaintly describes them as making two good things, philosophy and politics, a little worse by perverting the objects of both. Men like Antiphon or Lysias would be types of the class. Out of a regard to the respectabilities of life, they are disposed to censure the interest which Socrates takes in the exhibition of the two brothers. They do not understand, any more than Crito, that he is pursuing his vocation of detecting the follies of mankind, which he finds \u2018not unpleasant.\u2019 (Cp.
