Passage: Charmides.The subject of the Charmides is Temperance or \u03c3\u03c9\u03d5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b7, a peculiarly Greek notion, which may also be rendered Moderation1, Modesty, Discretion, Wisdom, without completely exhausting by all these terms the various associations of the word. It may be described as \u2018mens sana in corpore sano,\u2019 the harmony or due proportion of the higher and lower elements of human nature which \u2018makes a man his own master,\u2019 according to the definition of the Republic. In the accompanying translation the word has been rendered in different places either Temperance or Wisdom, as the connection seemed to require: for in the philosophy of Plato \u03c3\u03c9\u03d5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b7 still retains an intellectual element (as Socrates is also said to have identified \u03c3\u03c9\u03d5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b7 with \u03c3\u03bf\u03d5\u03af\u03b1: Xen. Mem. iii. 9, 4), and is not yet relegated to the sphere of moral virtue, as in the Nicomachean Ethics of Aristotle (iii. 10).Analysis.The beautiful youth, Charmides, who is also the most temperate of human beings, is asked by Socrates, \u2018What is Temperance?\u2019 He answers characteristically, (1) \u2018Quietness.\u2019 \u2018But Temperance is a fine and noble thing; and quietness in many or most cases is not so fine a thing as quickness.\u2019 He tries again and says (2) that temperance is modesty. But this again is set aside by a sophistical application of Homer: for temperance is good as well as noble, and Homer has declared that \u2018modesty is not good for a needy man.\u2019 (3) Once more Charmides makes the attempt. This time he gives a definition which he has heard, and of which Socrates conjectures that Critias must be the author: \u2018Temperance is doing one\u2019s own business.\u2019 But the artisan who makes another man\u2019s shoes may be temperate, and yet he is not doing his own business; and temperance defined thus would be opposed to the division of labour which exists in every temperate or well\u2013ordered state.  Question:  How is this riddle to be explained? Do you think the given passage is sufficient to answer this question, yes or no? If yes, first give step-by-step reasoning about how to answer the question. Then output the answer.",
        "target": "Critias, who takes the place of Charmides, distinguishes in his answer between \u2018making\u2019 and \u2018doing,\u2019 and with the help of a misapplied quotation from Hesiod assigns to the words \u2018doing\u2019 and \u2018work\u2019 an exclusively good sense: Temperance is doing one\u2019s own business;\u2014(4) is doing good.",
        "response": "The question asks, "How is this riddle to be explained?" The riddle, as presented in the passage, revolves around the definition of the term "Temperance" or "\u03c3\u03c9\u03d5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b7" and the various answers provided by Charmides, each of which Socrates refutes.

To determine if the given passage is sufficient to answer the question, let's evaluate the content of the passage step-by-step:

1. **The Definition of Temperance:** The passage begins by explaining the various interpretations and nuances of the term "Temperance" or "\u03c3\u03c9\u03d5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b7." It is highlighted as a unique Greek concept, which carries a range of meanings, including Moderation, Modesty, Discretion, Wisdom, etc. The idea of a balanced and harmonious human nature is emphasized. This provides background and context.

2. **Charmides' First Answer:** Charmides first defines Temperance as "Quietness." However, Socrates refutes this by saying that while Temperance is noble, quietness isn't always considered fine or noble, especially when compared to quickness.

3. **Charmides' Second Answer:** Charmides then proposes that Temperance is "modesty." Socrates counters this with an application of Homer's work, asserting that while Temperance is both good and noble, Homer mentions that "modesty is not good for a needy man."

4. **Charmides' Third Answer:** Charmides offers a third definition, possibly sourced from Critias: "Temperance is doing one’s own business." Socrates disputes this by pointing out that someone, like an artisan making another man's shoes, can be temperate without necessarily doing their own business. Moreover, this definition conflicts with the concept of the division of labor in a well-ordered society.

Having broken down the passage, it's evident that the passage provides enough information to explain the "riddle" of defining Temperance, as presented through the dialogues of Socrates and Charmides.

**Answer:** 
The riddle revolves around the elusive definition of Temperance. Charmides, prompted by Socrates, attempts multiple definitions, but each is systematically refuted by Socrates. The challenge lies in capturing the essence of Temperance, a concept both intricate and multifaceted in nature. Despite the various attempts to define it, the dialogue showcases the complexity and depth of Greek philosophical thought, emphasizing that some concepts, like Temperance, may not be easily confined to a single definition."

        "prompt": "I will give you a passage and a question, you are an expert in this, please provide a precise answer. Passage: Still an element of knowledge is wanting which Critias is readily induced to admit at the suggestion of Socrates; and, in the spirit of Socrates and of Greek life generally, proposes as a fifth definition, (5) Temperance is self\u2013knowledge. But all sciences have a subject: number is the subject of arithmetic, health of medicine\u2014what is the subject of temperance or wisdom? The answer is that (6) Temperance is the knowledge of what a man knows and of what he does not know. But this is contrary to analogy; there is no vision of vision, but only of visible things; no love of loves, but only of beautiful things; how then can there be a knowledge of knowledge? That which is older, heavier, lighter, is older, heavier, and lighter than something else, not than itself, and this seems to be true of all relative notions\u2014the object of relation is outside of them; at any rate they can only have relation to themselves in the form of that object. Whether there are any such cases of reflex relation or not, and whether that sort of knowledge which we term Temperance is of this reflex nature has yet to be determined by the great metaphysician. But even if knowledge can know itself, how does the knowledge of what we know imply the knowledge of what we do not know? Besides, knowledge is an abstraction only, and will not inform us of any particular subject, such as medicine, building, and the like. It may tell us that we or other men know something, but can never tell us what we know.Admitting that there is a knowledge of what we know and of what we do not know, which would supply a rule and measure of all things, still there would be no good in this; and the knowledge which temperance gives must be of a kind which will do us good; for temperance is a good. But this universal knowledge does not tend to our happiness and good: the only kind of knowledge which brings happiness is the knowledge of good and evil. To this Critias replies that the science or knowledge of good and evil, and all the other sciences, are regulated by the higher science or knowledge of knowledge. Socrates replies by again dividing the abstract from the concrete, and asks how this knowledge conduces to happiness in the same definite way in which medicine conduces to health.And now, after making all these concessions, which are really inadmissible, we are still as far as ever from ascertaining the nature of temperance, which Charmides has already discovered, and had therefore better rest in the knowledge that the more temperate he is the happier he will be, and not trouble himself with the speculations of Socrates.Introduction.In this Dialogue may be noted (1) The Greek ideal of beauty and goodness, the vision of the fair soul in the fair body, realised in the beautiful Charmides; (2) The true conception of medicine as a science ofthe whole as well as the parts, and of the mind as well as the body, which is playfully intimated in the story of the Thracian; (3) The tendency of the age to verbal distinctions, which here, as in the Protagoras and Cratylus, are ascribed to the ingenuity of Prodicus; and to interpretations or rather parodies of Homer or Hesiod, which are eminently characteristic of Plato and his contemporaries; (4) The germ of an ethical principle contained in the notion that temperance is \u2018doing one\u2019s own business,\u2019 which in the Republic (such is the shifting character of the Platonic philosophy) is given as the definition, not of temperance, but of justice; (5) The impatience which is exhibited by Socrates of any definition of temperance in which an element of science or knowledge is not included; (6) The beginning of metaphysics and logic implied in the two questions: whether there can be a science of science, and whether the knowledge of what you know is the same as the knowledge of what you do not know; and also in the distinction between \u2018what you know\u2019 and \u2018that you know,\u2019 \u1f03 \u03bf\u1f76\u03b4\u03b5\u03bd and \u1f45\u03c4\u03b9 \u03bf\u0269\u0313\u0302\u03b4\u03b5\u03bd; here too is the first conception of an absolute self\u2013determined science (the claims of which, however, are disputed by Socrates, who asks cui bono?) as well as the first suggestion of the difficulty of the abstract and concrete, and one of the earliest anticipations of the relation of subject and object, and of the subjective element in knowledge\u2014a \u2018rich banquet\u2019 of metaphysical questions in which we \u2018taste of many things.\u2019 (7) And still the mind of Plato, having snatched for a moment at these shadows of the future, quickly rejects them: thus early has he reached the conclusion that there can be no science which is a \u2018science of nothing\u2019 (Parmen. 132 B). (8) The conception of a science of good and evil also first occurs here, an anticipation of the Philebus and Republic as well as of moral philosophy in later ages.The dramatic interest of the Dialogue chiefly centres in the youth Charmides, with whom Socrates talks in the kindly spirit of an elder. His childlike simplicity and ingenuousness are contrasted with the dialectical and rhetorical arts of Critias, who is the grown\u2013up man of the world, having a tincture of philosophy. No hint is given, either here or in the Timaeus, of the infamy which attaches to the name of the latter in Athenian history. He is simply a cultivated person who, like his kinsman Plato, is ennobled by the connection of his family with Solon (cp. Tim. 20, 21), and had been the follower, if not the disciple, both of Socrates and of the Sophists. In the argument he is not unfair, if allowance is made for a slight rhetorical tendency, and for a natural desire to save his reputation with the company; he is sometimes nearer the truth than Socrates. Nothing in his language or behaviour is unbecoming the guardian of the beautiful Charmides. His love of reputation is characteristically Greek, and contrasts with the humility of Socrates. Nor in Charmides himself do we find any resemblance to the Charmides of history, except, perhaps, the modest and retiring nature which, according to Xenophon, at one time of his life prevented him from speaking in the Assembly (Mem. 3, 7); and we are surprised to hear that, like Critias, he afterwards became one of the thirty tyrants. In the Dialogue he is a pattern of virtue, and is therefore in no need of the charm which Socrates is unable to apply. With youthful na\u00efvet\u00e9, keeping his secret and entering into the spirit of Socrates, he enjoys the detection of his elder and guardian Critias, who is easily seen to be the author of the definition which he has so great an interest in maintaining (262 B). The preceding definition, \u2018Temperance is doing one\u2019s own business,\u2019 is assumed to have been borrowed by Charmides from another; and when the enquiry becomes more abstract he is superseded by Critias (cp. Theaet. 168 E; Euthyd. 290 E). Socrates preserves his accustomed irony to the end; he is in the neighbourhood of several great truths, which he views in various lights, but always either by bringing them to the test of common sense, or by demanding too great exactness in the use of words, turns aside from them and comes at last to no conclusion.The definitions of temperance proceed in regular order from the popular to the philosophical. The first two are simple enough and partially true, like the first thoughts of an intelligent youth; the third, which is a real contribution to ethical philosophy, is perverted by the ingenuity of Socrates, and hardly rescued by an equal perversion on the part of Critias. The remaining definitions have a higher aim, which is to introduce the element of knowledge, and at last to unite good and truth in a single science. But the time has not yet arrived for the realization of this vision of metaphysical philosophy; and such a science when brought nearer to us in the Philebus and the Republic will not be called by the name of \u03c3\u03c9\u03d5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b7.  Question:  Hence we see with surprise that Plato, who in his other writings identifies good and knowledge, here opposes them, and asks, almost in the spirit of Aristotle, how can there be a knowledge of knowledge, and even if attainable, how can such a knowledge be of any use? Do you think the given passage is sufficient to answer this question, yes or no? If yes, first give step-by-step reasoning about how to answer the question. Then output the answer.",
        "target": "The difficulty of the Charmides arises chiefly from the two senses of the word \u03c3\u03c9\u03d5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b7, or temperance. From the ethical notion of temperance, which is variously defined to be quietness, modesty, doing our own business, the doing of good actions, the dialogue passes on to the intellectual conception of \u03c3\u03c9\u03d5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b7, which is declared also to be the science of self\u2013knowledge, or of the knowledge of what we know and do not know, or of the knowledge of good and evil. The dialogue represents a stage in the history of philosophy in which knowledge and action were not yet distinguished. Hence the confusion between them, and the easy transition from one to the other. The definitions which are offered are all rejected, but it is to be observed that they all tend to throw a light on the nature of temperance, and that, unlike the distinction of Critias between \u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03b5\u00ee\u03bd, \u03c0\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd, \u1f10\u03c1\u03b3\u03ac\u03b6\u03b5\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9, none of them are merely verbal quibbles. It is implied that this question, although it has not yet received a solution in theory, has been already answered by Charmides himself, who has learned to practise the virtue of self\u2013knowledge which philosophers are vainly trying to define in words. In a similar spirit we might say to a young man who is disturbed by theological difficulties, \u2018Do not trouble yourself about such matters, but only lead a good life;\u2019 and yet in either case it is not to be denied that right ideas of truth may contribute greatly to the improvement of character.",
        "response": "Yes, the given passage is sufficient to answer the question. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Context**: The passage delves into the discussion about temperance and knowledge, and how the two can or cannot be intertwined. The central theme is around the definitions of temperance and the element of knowledge.

2. **Plato's Stand on Good and Knowledge**: The passage indicates that Plato, in other works, often identifies "good" with "knowledge".

3. **Opposition in this Dialogue**: In the excerpt provided, Plato questions the very relationship between good and knowledge that he usually supports. This is evident in the text where it's mentioned, "...asks how this knowledge conduces to happiness in the same definite way in which medicine conduces to health."

4. **The Specific Query**: The passage raises the question of whether there can be a "knowledge of knowledge", hinting at the meta-cognitive aspect of knowledge. This ties back to the query about the nature of such knowledge and its utility.

5. **Conclusion Drawn in the Passage**: The dialogue, through the voice of Socrates, shows skepticism towards the utility of this "knowledge of knowledge". It states: "...how does the knowledge of what we know imply the knowledge of what we do not know? Besides, knowledge is an abstraction only, and will not inform us of any particular subject..."

Answer:
Plato, in this dialogue, questions the relationship between good and knowledge, which he usually identifies with each other in other writings. He expresses skepticism towards the idea of "knowledge of knowledge", questioning its utility and practical implications, which is contrasting to his usual stance."

        "prompt": "I will give you a passage and a question, you are an expert in this, please provide a precise answer. Passage: The reasons why the Charmides, Lysis, Laches have been placed together and first in the series of Platonic dialogues, are: (i) Their shortness and simplicity. The Charmides and the Lysis, if not the Laches, are of the same \u2018quality\u2019 as the Phaedrus and Symposium: and it is probable, though far from certain, that the slighter effort preceded the greater one. (ii) Their eristic, or rather Socratic character; they belong to the class called dialogues of search (\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03af), which have no conclusion. (iii) The absence in them of certain favourite notions of Plato, such as the doctrine of recollection and of the Platonic ideas; the questions, whether virtue can be taught; whether the virtues are one or many. (iv) They have a want of depth, when compared with the dialogues of the middle and later period; and a youthful beauty and grace which is wanting in the later ones. (v) Their resemblance to one another; in all the three boyhood has a great part. These reasons have various degrees of weight in determining their place in the catalogue of the Platonic writings, though they are not conclusive. No arrangement of the Platonic dialogues can be strictly chronological. The order which has been adopted is intended mainly for the convenience of the reader; at the same time, indications of the date supplied either by Plato himself or allusions found in the dialogues have not been lost sight of. Much may be said about this subject, but the results can only be probable; there are no materials which would enable us to attain to anything like certainty.The relations of knowledge and virtue are again brought forward in the companion dialogues of the Lysis and Laches; and also in the Protagoras and Euthydemus. The opposition of abstract and particular knowledge in this dialogue may be compared with a similar opposition of ideas and phenomena which occurs in the Prologue to the Parmenides, but seems rather to belong to a later stage of the philosophy of Plato.CHARMIDES, OR TEMPERANCE.PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE.Socrates, who is the narrator.Chaerephon.Charmides.Critias.Scene:\u2014The Palaestra of Taureas, which is near the Porch of the King Archon.Charmides.Chaerephon, Socrates.Socrates, who has just returned to Athens, visits his old friends and tells them the news from the army at Potidaea.Yesterday evening I returned from the army at Potidaea, and having been a good while away, I thought that I should like to go and look at my old haunts. So I went into the palaestra of Taureas, which is over against the temple adjoining the porch of the King Archon, and there I found a number of persons, most of whom I knew, but not all. My visit was unexpected, and no sooner did they see me entering than they saluted me from afar on all sides; and Chaerephon, who is a kind of madman, started up and ran to me, seizing my hand, and saying, How did you escape, Socrates?\u2014(I should explain that an engagement had taken place at Potidaea not long before we came away, of which the news had only just reached Athens.)You see, I replied, that here I am.There was a report, he said, that the engagement was very severe, and that many of our acquaintance had fallen.That, I replied, was not far from the truth.I suppose, he said, that you were present.I was.Then sit down, and tell us the whole story, which as yet we have only heard imperfectly.I took the place which he assigned to me, by the side of Critias the son of Callaeschrus, and when I had saluted him and the rest of the company, I told them the news from the army, and answered their several enquiries.He proceeds to make enquiries about the state of philosophy and about the youth; and is told of the beautiful Charmides,Then, when there had been enough of this, I, in my turn, began to make enquiries about matters at home\u2014about the present state of philosophy, and about the youth. I asked whether any of them were remarkable for wisdom or beauty, or both. Critias, glancing at the door, invited my attention to some youths who were coming in, and talking noisily to one another, followed by a crowd. Of the beauties, Socrates, he said, I fancy that you will soon be able to form a judgment. For those who are just entering are the advanced guard of the great beauty, as he is thought to be, of the day, and he is likely to be not far off himself.Who is he, I said;  Question:  and who is his father?

Great amusement was occasioned by every one pushing with might and main at his neighbour in order to make a place for him next to themselves, until at the two ends of the row one had to get up and the other was rolled over sideways. Now I, my friend, was beginning to feel awkward; my former bold belief in my powers of conversing with him had vanished.

Passage: The eyes, as physicians tell us, cannot be cured without the head, nor the head without the body;I am glad to find that you remember me, I said; for I shall now be more at home with you and shall be better able to explain the nature of the charm, about which I felt a difficulty before. For the charm will do more, Charmides, than only cure the headache. I dare say that you have heard eminent physicians say to a patient who comes to them with bad eyes, that they cannot cure his eyes by themselves, but that if his eyes are to be cured, his head must be treated; and then again they say that to think of curing the head alone, and not the rest of the body also, is the height of folly. And arguing in this way they apply their methods to the whole body, and try to treat and heal the whole and the part together.  Question:  Did you ever observe that this is what they say?

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The question is about whether someone has observed that physicians make a specific statement.
2. The passage describes that physicians say the eyes cannot be cured without treating the head, and the head can't be cured without treating the body.
3. The passage specifically says, "I dare say that you have heard eminent physicians say..." which implies that this is what physicians say.

Answer: "that they cannot cure his eyes by themselves, but that if his eyes are to be cured, his head must be treated; and then again they say that to think of curing the head alone, and not the rest of the body also, is the height of folly.""

Passage: nor the body without the soul.His approving answers reassured me, and I began by degrees to regain confidence, and the vital heat returned. Such, Charmides, I said, is the nature of the charm, which I learned when serving with the army from one of the physicians of the Thracian king Zamolxis, who are said to be so skilful that they can even give immortality. This Thracian told me that in these notions of theirs, which I was just now mentioning, the Greek physicians are quite right as far as they go; but Zamolxis, he added, our king, who is also a god, says further, \u2018that as you ought not to attempt to cure the eyes without the head, or the head without the body, so neither ought you to attempt to cure the body without the soul; and this,\u2019 he said, \u2018is the reason why the cure of many diseases is unknown to the physicians of Hellas, because they are ignorant of the whole, which ought to be studied also; for the part can never be well unless the whole is well.\u2019 For all good and evil, whether in the body or in human nature, originates, as he declared, in the soul, and overflows from thence, as if from the head into the eyes. And therefore if the head and body are to be well, you must begin by curing the soul; that is the first thing. And the cure, my dear youth, has to be effected by the use of certain charms, and these charms are fair words; and by them temperance is implanted in the soul, and where temperance is, there health is speedily imparted, not only to the head, but to the whole body. And he who taught me the cure and the charm at the same time added a special direction: \u2018Let no one,\u2019 he said, \u2018persuade you to cure the head, until he has first given you his soul to be cured by the charm. For this,\u2019 he said, \u2018is the great error of our day in the treatment of the human body, that physicians separate the soul from the body.\u2019 And he added with emphasis, at the same time making me swear to his words, \u2018Let no one, however rich, or noble, or fair, persuade you to give him the cure, without the charm.\u2019 Now I have sworn, and I must keep my oath, and therefore if you will allow me to apply the Thracian charm first to your soul, as the stranger directed, I will afterwards proceed to apply the cure to your head. But if not, I do not know what I am to do with you, my dear Charmides.Critias, when he heard this, said: The headache will be an unexpected gain to my young relation, if the pain in his head compels him to improve his mind: and I can tell you, Socrates, that Charmides is not only pre-eminent in beauty among his equals, but also in that quality which is given by the charm;  Question:  and this, as you say, is temperance?

3. The respondent in the passage ("he said") agrees, suggesting an affirmation of whatever statement or implication was made.
4. Given that the referenced statement or implication (from a separate prior passage) was about the dual nature of modesty being both good and not good in different circumstances (as evidenced by Homer's quote), the respondent's agreement ("Yes, he said; I agree.") can be used to infer his stance on the nature of modesty.

Yes, modesty is and is not good, depending on the context or circumstance."

1. The question is asking whether temperance can be the same as modesty, based on certain characteristics or properties of each.
2. The passage suggests that there's an agreement that something (from a prior context) is as described, though the specifics of that thing are not explicitly mentioned in this passage.
3. The question provides additional context, indicating that temperance is considered a good, and modesty has dual characteristics—it can be both an evil and a good.
4. The query is essentially trying to understand whether something (temperance) that is purely good can be equated to something (modesty) that is sometimes good and sometimes not.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The passage starts by emphasizing that the statement "temperance is a man doing his own business" has a deeper, hidden meaning and that its superficial interpretation is likely incorrect.
2. The question asks whether a state would function well if everyone was limited to only doing tasks strictly related to themselves, like making their own clothes and tools, which aligns with the superficial interpretation of "every one doing and performing his own."
3. The passage suggests skepticism about the literal interpretation of the statement by mentioning that the originator of the statement couldn't have meant it so simplistically.

The author of the passage does not believe that a state would be well-ordered if every individual was compelled to perform every task for themselves, based on the literal interpretation of "every one doing and performing his own.""

Passage: No more, he replied, than making or working are the same; thus much I have learned from Hesiod, who says that \u2018work is no disgrace.\u2019 Now do you imagine that if he had meant by working and doing such things as you were describing, he would have said that there was no disgrace in them\u2014for example, in the manufacture of shoes, or in selling pickles, or sitting for hire in a house of ill\u2013fame? That, Socrates, is not to be supposed: but I conceive him to have distinguished making from doing and work; and, while admitting that the making anything might sometimes become a disgrace, when the employment was not honourable, to have thought that work was never any disgrace at all. For things nobly and usefully made he called works; and such makings he called workings, and doings; and he must be supposed to have called such things only man\u2019s proper business, and what is hurtful, not his business: and in that sense Hesiod, and any other wise man, may be reasonably supposed to call him wise who does his own work.O Critias, I said, no sooner had you opened your mouth, than I pretty well knew that you would call that which is proper to a man, and that which is his own, good; and that the makings (\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2) of the good you would call doings (\u03c0\u03c1\u03ac\u03be\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2), for I am no stranger to the endless distinctions which Prodicus draws about names.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The question is asking if "they" are temperate even though they might not make things just for themselves or their own business.
2. From the passage, we understand that "doing one's own business" is considered wise and there's a distinction between "making" and "doing."
3. Critias believes that making something could be a disgrace when the employment isn't honorable, but "work" as in doing one's own proper business is never disgraceful.
4. The wise are referred to as those who do their own work, implying a sense of temperance in doing what's proper for oneself.

Passage: But that, Socrates, he said, is impossible; and therefore if this is, as you imply, the necessary consequence of any of my previous admissions, I will withdraw them, rather than admit that a man can be temperate or wise who does not know himself; and I am not ashamed to confess that I was in error. For self\u2013knowledge would certainly be maintained by me to be the very essence of knowledge, and in this I agree with him who dedicated the inscription, \u2018Know thyself!\u2019 at Delphi. That word, if I am not mistaken, is put there as a sort of salutation which the god addresses to those who enter the temple; as much as to say that the ordinary salutation of \u2018Hail!\u2019 is not right, and that the exhortation \u2018Be temperate!\u2019 would be a far better way of saluting one another. The notion of him who dedicated the inscription was, as I believe, that the god speaks to those who enter his temple, not as men speak; but, when a worshipper enters, the first word which he hears is \u2018Be temperate!\u2019 This, however, like a prophet he expresses in a sort of riddle, for \u2018Know thyself!\u2019 and \u2018Be temperate!\u2019 are the same, as I maintain, and as the letters imply [\u03c3\u03c9\u03d5\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9, \u03b3\u03bd\u0175\u03b8\u03b9 \u03c3\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd], and yet they may be easily misunderstood; and succeeding sages who added \u2018Never too much,\u2019 or, \u2018Give a pledge, and evil is nigh at hand,\u2019 would appear to have so misunderstood them; for they imagined that \u2018Know thyself!\u2019 was a piece of advice which the god gave, and not his salutation of the worshippers at their first coming in; and they dedicated their own inscription under the idea that they too would give equally useful pieces of advice. Shall I tell you, Socrates, why I say all this? My object is to leave the previous discussion (in which I know not whether you or I are more right, but, at any rate, no clear result was attained), and to raise a new one in which I will attempt to prove, if you deny, that temperance is self\u2013knowledge.Yes, I said, Critias; but you come to me as though I professed to know about the questions which I ask, and as though I could, if I only would, agree with you1.

Please then to allow me time to reflect.Reflect, he said.But temperance is also a science of something.I am reflecting, I replied, and discover that temperance, or wisdom, if implying a knowledge of anything, must be a science, and a science of something.Yes, he said; the science of itself.

I altogether distrust my own power of determining these matters: I am not certain whether there is such a science of science at all; and even if there be, I should not acknowledge this to be wisdom or temperance, until I can also see whether such a science would or would not do us any good; for I have an impression that temperance is a benefit and a good.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The question asks whether, in various examples, the concept of a relation to self is either inadmissible or hardly believable, specifically mentioning magnitudes, numbers, and the like.
2. The passage states, "Very likely, I said; but I remain as stupid as ever; for still I fail to comprehend how this knowing what you know and do not know is the same as the knowledge of self." This suggests that the speaker struggles with the concept of knowledge relating to itself.
3. The passage continues with "never give us a knowledge of other things; for it is incapable of distinguishing them." This implies that certain knowledge doesn't relate to other things, hinting at the inadmissibility or incredibility of a relation to self in some contexts.
4. The acknowledgment that "there is a science of science" doesn't directly address the specific examples of magnitudes and numbers, but it establishes that the discussion revolves around self-referential concepts.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The passage discusses the idea that having knowledge of specific arts or sciences, like medicine or music, doesn't equate to having wisdom or temperance. This indicates that each type of knowledge is distinct.
2. The passage further emphasizes that "The science or knowledge of knowledge is unmeaning and unprofitable."
3. Given the distinctions made about specific arts and the statement about the "knowledge of knowledge," it implies that just because someone possesses the capability of self-knowledge doesn't necessarily mean they understand everything they know and don't know in various fields.

Based on the passage, having the capability of self-knowledge doesn't automatically grant someone comprehensive knowledge of everything they understand or are ignorant about in different fields. The knowledge of particular arts or subjects is separate from the broader concept of self-knowledge."

1. The passage states that the physician knows medicine but doesn't know about "science," which has been assumed to be the domain of wisdom.
2. It is emphasized that the wise man will know that the physician has some kind of science or knowledge, but when trying to identify the specific nature of this knowledge, he'll ask about its subject-matter.
3. Sciences are distinguished not just by being sciences but by the nature of their subjects, as highlighted in the passage.
4. If someone is unaware of these distinctions and the specific subjects, they will only know that they possess knowledge but won't recognize the specific content of that knowledge.

Answer:
Yes, he who is ignorant of these things will only know that he knows, but not what he knows."

Passage: No one at all, it would seem, except the physician can have this knowledge; and therefore not the wise man; he would have to be a physician as well as a wise man.Very true.This science of science and of the absence of science which has raised such great expectations in our minds is shown to be impossible.Then, assuredly, wisdom or temperance, if only a science of science, and of the absence of science or knowledge, will not be able to distinguish the physician who knows from one who does not know but pretends or thinks that he knows, or any other professor of anything at all; like any other artist, he will only know his fellow in art or wisdom, and no one else.That is evident, he said.But then what profit, Critias, I said, is there any longer in wisdom or temperance which yet remains, if this is wisdom? If, indeed, as we were supposing at first, the wise man had been able to distinguish what he knew and did not know, and that he knew the one and did not know the other, and to recognize a similar faculty of discernment in others, there would certainly have been a great advantage in being wise; for then we should never have made a mistake, but have passed through life the unerring guides of ourselves and of those who are under us; and we should not have attempted to do what we did not know, but we should have found out those who knew, and have handed the business over to them and trusted in them; nor should we have allowed those who were under us to do anything which they were not likely to do well; and they would be likely to do well just that of which they had knowledge; and the house or state which was ordered or administered under the guidance of wisdom, and everything else of which wisdom was the lord, would have been well ordered; for truth guiding, and error having been eliminated, in all their doings, men would have done well, and would have been happy.

        "target": "Very true, he said.",
        "response": "Yes, the given passage is sufficient to answer the question.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The passage starts by discussing the limitations of a "wise man" and his inability to distinguish between those who genuinely possess a specific knowledge, like that of a physician, from those who pretend or believe they have it but don't.
  
2. The passage mentions: "the wise man had been able to distinguish what he knew and did not know, and that he knew the one and did not know the other, and to recognize a similar faculty of discernment in others." This implies that a genuinely wise person would have the ability to discern true knowledge in specific domains.

3. It also states: "we should have found out those who knew, and have handed the business over to them and trusted in them" which supports the idea that the wise man, if he were truly wise in this context, would be able to identify true professionals in their fields.

4. Further, it emphasizes the importance of having the right knowledge and expertise for specific tasks, suggesting that it is imperative to accurately judge the physician as a physician in what relates to his domain of expertise.

Answer: Yes, he who judges rightly will judge of the physician as a physician in what relates to these."

Reasoning:

1. The passage focuses on the advantages of possessing "a knowledge of knowledge and ignorance," emphasizing that this meta-knowledge allows an individual to learn more easily, have clearer insights, and better test the knowledge of others.

2. It discusses the benefits of wisdom in terms of understanding knowledge more broadly and having sharper insights when engaging with specific domains of knowledge.

3. However, the passage does not directly address the topic of considering "whether what one says is true, and whether what one does is right, in relation to health and disease."

3. The passage raises doubts about the real advantages of having each individual do what they know and delegating what they don't know to those more knowledgeable.

Passage: How very strange, Socrates!By the dog of Egypt, I said, there I agree with you; and I was thinking as much just now when I said that strange consequences would follow, and that I was afraid we were on the wrong track; for however ready we may be to admit that this is wisdom, I certainly cannot make out what good this sort of thing does to us.What do you mean? he said; I wish that you could make me understand what you mean.I dare say that what I am saying is nonsense, I replied; and yet if a man has any feeling of what is due to himself, he cannot let the thought which comes into his mind pass away unheeded and unexamined.I like that, he said.A dream of universal knowledge.But the possession of all this knowledge will not necessarily give the knowledge of good and evil which can alone make men happy.Hear, then, I said, my own dream; whether coming through the horn or the ivory gate, I cannot tell. The dream is this: Let us suppose that wisdom is such as we are now defining, and that she has absolute sway over us; then each action will be done according to the arts or sciences, and no one professing to be a pilot when he is not, or any physician or general, or any one else pretending to know matters of which he is ignorant, will deceive or elude us; our health will be improved; our safety at sea, and also in battle, will be assured; our coats and shoes, and all other instruments and implements will be skilfully made, because the workmen will be good and true. Aye, and if you please, you may suppose that prophecy, which is the knowledge of the future, will be under the control of wisdom, and that she will deter deceivers and set up the true prophets in their place as the revealers of the future. Now I quite agree that mankind, thus provided, would live and act according to knowledge, for wisdom would watch and prevent ignorance from intruding on us. But whether by acting according to knowledge we shall act well and be happy, my dear Critias,\u2014this is a point which we have not yet been able to determine.Yet I think, he replied, that if you discard knowledge, you will hardly find the crown of happiness in anything else.But of what is this knowledge? I said. Just answer me that small question.  Question:  Was not this, Critias, what we spoke of as the great advantage of wisdom\u2014to know what is known and what is unknown to us?

1. The passage starts with a discussion about the nature and implications of possessing wisdom, specifically the kind that pertains to knowing what one knows and what one doesn't.

2. Socrates presents a dream scenario where wisdom, defined in this way, reigns supreme, leading to actions being executed according to specific arts or sciences. In this scenario, deception based on ignorance would be eliminated, resulting in better health, safety, craftsmanship, and true prophecies.

3. Later in the passage, Socrates asks Critias about the true nature of knowledge, suggesting that they had previously discussed the advantage of wisdom as knowing what is and isn't known.

But now I have been utterly defeated, and have failed to discover what that is to which the imposer of names gave this name of temperance or wisdom. And yet many more admissions were made by us than could be fairly granted; for we admitted that there was a science of science, although the argument said No, and protested against us; and we admitted further, that this science knew the works of the other sciences (although this too was denied by the argument), because we wanted to show that the wise man had knowledge of what he knew and did not know; also we nobly disregarded, and never even considered, the impossibility of a man knowing in a sort of way that which he does not know at all; for our assumption was, that he knows that which he does not know; than which nothing, as I think, can be more irrational. And yet, after finding us so easy and good\u2013natured, the enquiry is still unable to discover the truth; but mocks us to a degree, and has gone out of its way to prove the inutility of that which we admitted only by a sort of supposition and fiction to be the true definition of temperance or wisdom: which result, as far as I am concerned, is not so much to be lamented, I said. But for your sake, Charmides, I am very sorry\u2014that you, having such beauty and such wisdom and temperance of soul, should have no profit or good in life from your wisdom and temperance. And still more am I grieved about the charm which I learned with so much pain, and to so little profit, from the Thracian, for the sake of a thing which is nothing worth. I think indeed that there is a mistake, and that I must be a bad enquirer, for wisdom or temperance I believe to be really a great good; and happy are you, Charmides, if you certainly possess it. Wherefore examine yourself, and see whether you have this gift and can do without the charm; for if you can, I would rather advise you to regard me simply as a fool who is never able to reason out anything; and to rest assured that the more wise and temperate you are, the happier you will be.Nevertheless Charmides is desirous to be charmed.Charmides said: I am sure that I do not know, Socrates, whether I have or have not this gift of wisdom and temperance; for how can I know whether I have a thing, of which even you and Critias are, as you say, unable to discover the nature?\u2014(not that I believe you.) And further, I am sure, Socrates, that I do need the charm, and as far as I am concerned, I shall be willing to be charmed by you daily, until you say that I have had enough.Very good, Charmides, said Critias; if you do this I shall have a proof of your temperance, that is, if you allow yourself to be charmed by Socrates, and never desert him at all.You may depend on my following and not deserting him, said Charmides: if you who are my guardian command me, I should be very wrong not to obey you.And I do command you, he said.Then I will do as you say, and begin this very day.
