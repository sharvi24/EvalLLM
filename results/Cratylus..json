[{"prompt": "Context:  Cratylus.\nIntroduction.\n\nThe Cratylus has always been a source of perplexity to the student of Plato. While in fancy and humour, and perfection of style and metaphysical originality, this dialogue may be ranked with the best of the Platonic writings, there has been an uncertainty about the motive of the piece, which interpreters have hitherto not succeeded in dispelling. We need not suppose that Plato used words in order to conceal his thoughts, or that he would have been unintelligible to an educated contemporary. In the Phaedrus and Euthydemus we also find a difficulty in determining the precise aim of the author. Plato wrote satires in the form of dialogues, and his meaning, like that of other satirical writers, has often slept in the ear of posterity. Two causes may be assigned for this obscurity: 1st, the subtlety and allusiveness of this species of composition; 2nd, the difficulty of reproducing a state of life and literature which has passed away. A satire is unmeaning unless we can place our", "output": "own age in the place of the age of the writer. In the Cratylus, as in the Euthydemus, Plato seems to have been attacking the Sophists, and to have been defending the etymological and grammatical tradition of the Athenian schools.\n\nCratylus, son of Bendis, was an Athenian sophist, who lived in the time of Socrates, and was one of the earliest and most famous of the sophists.

Had the treatise of Antisthenes upon words, or the speculations of Cratylus, or some other Heracleitean of the fourth century b.c., on the nature of language been preserved to us; or if we had lived at the time, and been \u2018rich enough to attend the fifty\u2013drachma course of Prodicus,\u2019 we should have understood Plato better, and many points which are now attributed to the extravagance of Socrates\u2019 humour would have been found, like the allusions of Aristophanes in the Clouds, to have gone home to the sophists and grammarians of the day.\nFor the age was very busy with philological speculation; and many questions were beginning to be asked about language which were parallel to other questions about justice, virtue, knowledge, and were illustrated in a similar manner by the analogy of the arts. Was there a correctness in words, and were they given by nature or convention?

They were also seeking to distinguish the parts of speech and to enquire into the relation of subject and predicate. Grammar and logic were moving about somewhere in the depths of the human soul, but they were not yet awakened into consciousness and had not found names for themselves, or terms by which they might be expressed. Of these beginnings of the study of language we know little, and there necessarily arises an obscurity when the surroundings of such a work as the Cratylus are taken away. Moreover, in this, as in most of the dialogues of Plato, allowance has to be made for the character of Socrates. For the theory of language can only be propounded by him in a manner which is consistent with his own profession of ignorance. Hence his ridicule of the new school of etymology is interspersed with many declarations, \u2018that he knows nothing,\u2019 \u2018that he has learned from Eu", "output": "phorion,\u2019 \u2018that he is not a philosopher.\u2019\n\nThe dialogue opens with the statement that Cratylus, the younger brother of Hermogenes, has come to Athens and is at the house of Hermogenes, to whom Socrates is also a guest. Cratylus is a disciple of Heraclitus, the founder of the philosophy of flux and fire. His brother, Hermogenes, is a disciple of Parmenides, the founder of the philosophy of being and unity. Cratylus is a man of learning, who has studied the", "target": null}, {"prompt": "thyphro,\u2019 and the like. Even the truest things which he says are depreciated by himself. He professes to be guessing, but the guesses of Plato are better than all the other theories of the ancients respecting language put together.\nThe dialogue hardly derives any light from Plato\u2019s other writings, and still less from Scholiasts and Neoplatonist writers. Socrates must be interpreted from himself, and on first reading we certainly have a difficulty in understanding his drift, or his relation to the two other interlocutors in the dialogue. Does he agree with Cratylus or with Hermogenes, and is he serious in those fanciful etymologies, extending over more than half the dialogue, which he seems so greatly to relish? Or is he serious in part only; and can we separate his jest from his earnest?\u2014Sunt bona, sunt quaedam mediocria, sunt mala plura.

And in the Cratylus we have no reason to assume that Socrates is either wholly right or wholly wrong, or that Plato, though he evidently inclines to him, had any other aim than that of personifying, in the characters of Hermogenes, Socrates, and Cratylus, the three theories of language which are respectively maintained by them.\nThe two subordinate persons of the dialogue, Hermogenes and Cratylus, are at the opposite poles of the argument.

First, Hermogenes, the poor brother of the rich Callias, expounds the doctrine that names are conventional; like the names of slaves, they may be given and altered at pleasure. This is one of those principles which, whether applied to society or language, explains everything and nothing. For in all things there is an element of convention; but the admission of this does not help us to understand the rational ground or basis in human nature on which the convention proceeds. Socrates first of all intimates to Hermogenes that his view of language is only a part of a sophistical whole, and ultimately tends to abolish the distinction between truth and falsehood. Hermogenes is very ready to throw aside the sophistical tenet, and listens with a sort of half admiration, half belief, to the speculations of Socrates.\nCratylus is of opinion that a name is either a true name or not a name at all.

He is inclined to derive all truth from language, and in language he sees reflected the philosophy of Heracleitus. His views are not like those of Hermogenes, hastily taken up, but are said to be the result of mature consideration, although he is described as still a young man. With a tenacity characteristic of the Heracleitean philosophers, he clings to the doctrine of the flux. (Cp. Theaet. 180.) Of the real Cratylus we know nothing, except that he is recorded by Aristotle to have been the friend or teacher of Plato; nor have we any proof that he resembled the likeness of him in Plato any more than the Critias of Plato is like the real Critias, or the Euthyphro in this dialogue l", "output": "ends any support to the doctrine of the eponymous hero.\nCratylus, the second of the dialogues of Plato, has, like the first, a tendency to a dissertation on the nature of language, and is, in fact, an attempt to explain the nature of the names of things.

Language is conventional and also natural, and the true conventional\u2013natural is the rational. It is a work not of chance, but of art; the dialectician is the artificer of words, and the legislator gives authority to them. They are the expressions or imitations in sound of things. In a sense, Cratylus is right in saying that things have by nature names (p. 390); for nature is not opposed either to art or to law. But vocal imitation, like any other copy, may be imperfectly executed; and in this way an element of chance or convention enters in. There is much which is accidental or exceptional in language. Some words have had their original meaning so obscured, that they require to be helped out by convention. But still the true name is that which has a natural meaning. Thus natur", "output": "a naturans is the true name of a natural thing; and natura naturata is the name of a thing which has a natural name.

The ideas are the objects of the understanding, and they are names of things; and therefore they are names of names.

And the three views respectively propounded by Hermogenes, Socrates, Cratylus, may be described as the conventional, the artificial or rational, and the natural. The view of Socrates is the meeting\u2013point of the other two, just as conceptualism is the meeting\u2013point of nominalism and realism.\nWe can hardly say that Plato was aware of the truth, that \u2018languages are not made, but grow.\u2019 But still, when he says that \u2018the legislator made language with the dialectician standing on his right hand,\u2019 we need not infer from this that he conceived words, like coins, to be issued from the mint of the State. The creator of laws and of social life is naturally regarded as the creator of language, according to Hellenic notions, and the philosopher is his natural adviser.

Of the process which he thus describes, Plato had probably no very definite notion. But he means to express generally that language is the product of intelligence, and that languages belong to States and not to individuals.\nA better conception of language could not have been formed in Plato\u2019s age, than that which he attributes to Socrates. Yet many persons have thought that the mind of Plato is more truly seen in the vague realism of Cratylus. This misconception has probably arisen from two causes: first, the desire to bring Plato\u2019s theory of language into accordance with the received doctrine of the Platonic ideas; secondly, the impression created by Socrates himself, that he is not in earnest, and is only indulging the fancy of the hour.\n1.

The second cause of the impression that the Platonic theory of language is not in earnest, is the familiarity of the reader with the Platonic dialogues.

(See Introductions to the Meno and the Sophist.) And in the Cratylus he gives a general account of the nature and origin of language, in which Adam Smith, Rousseau, and other writers of the last century, would have substantially agreed. At the end of the dialogue, he speaks as in the Symposium and Republic of absolute beauty and good; but he never supposed that they were capable of being embodied in words. Of the names of the ideas, he would have said, as he says of the names of the Gods, that we know nothing. Even the realism of Cratylus is not based upon the ideas of Plato, but upon the flux of Heracleitus. Here, as in the Sophist and Politicus, Plato expressly draws attention to the want of agreement in words and things.

He is discoursing in a high\u2013flown vein, which may be compared to the \u2018dithyrambics of the Phaedrus.\u2019 They are mysteries of which he is speaking, and he professes a kind of ludicrous fear of his imaginary wisdom. When he is arguing out of Homer, about the names of Hector\u2019s son, or when he describes himself as inspired or maddened by Euthyphro, with whom he has been sitting from the early dawn (cp. Phaedrus and Lysias; Phaedr.) and expresses his intention of yielding to the illusion to\u2013day, and to\u2013morrow he will go to a priest and be purified, we easily see that his words are not to be taken seriously.

There he is parodying the ingenious follies of early logic; in the Cratylus he is ridiculing the fancies of a new school of sophists and grammarians. The fallacies of the Euthydemus are still retained at the end of our logic books; and the etymologies of the Cratylus have also found their way into later writers. Some of these are not much worse than the conjectures of Hemsterhuis, and other critics of the last century; but this does not prove that they are serious. For Plato is in advance of his age in his conception of language, as much as he is in his conception of mythology. (Cp.

The Socrates who \u2018knows nothing,\u2019 here passes into the teacher, the dialectician, the arranger of species. There is nothing in this part of the dialogue which is either weak or extravagant. Plato is a supporter of the Onomatopoetic theory of language; that is to say, he supposes words to be formed by the imitation of ideas in sounds; he also recognises the effect of time, the influence of foreign languages, the desire of euphony, to be formative principles; and he admits a certain element of chance.

The word \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03cd\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 is found in the Septuagint, and is a form of the word \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03c5\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7, which is in the perfect tense, \u1f00\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03c5\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7. Secondly, \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03cd\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 is an adjective, and", "target": null}, {"prompt": "ger or absolver (\u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03cd\u03c9\u03bd); secondly, he is the true diviner, \u1f09\u03c0\u03bb\u0175\u03c2, as he is called in the Thessalian dialect (\u1f01\u03c0\u03bb\u0175\u03c2 = \u1f01\u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u0302\u03c2, sincere); thirdly, he is the archer (\u1f00\u03b5\u1f76 \u03b2\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd), always shooting; or again, supposing \u03b1 to mean \u1f03\u03bc\u03b1 or \u1f43\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5, Apollo becomes equivalent to \u1f03\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u0175\u03bd, which points to both his musical and his heavenly attributes; for there is a \u2018moving together\u2019 alike in music and in the harmony of the spheres. The second \u03bb is inserted in order to avoid the ill\u2013omened sound of destruction.

The gentle Leto or Letho is named from her willingness (\u1f10\u03b8\u03b5\u03bb\u03ae\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd), or because she is ready to forgive and forget (\u03bb\u03ae\u03b8\u03b7). Artemis is so called from her healthy well\u2013balanced nature, \u03b4\u03b9\u1f70 \u03c4\u1f78 \u1f00\u03c1\u03c4\u03b5\u03bc\u1f72\u03c2, or as \u1f00\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03b7\u0302\u03c2 \u1f35\u03c3\u03c4\u03c9\u03c1; or as a lover of virginity, \u1f04\u03c1\u03bf\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03bc\u03b9\u03c3\u03ae\u03c3\u03b1\u03c3\u03b1. One of these explanations is probably true,\u2014perhaps all of them.

For Athene we must turn to the allegorical interpreters of Homer, who make the name equivalent to \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03bd\u03cc\u03b7, or possibly the word was originally \u1f20\u03b8\u03bf\u03bd\u03cc\u03b7 and signified moral intelligence (\u1f10\u03bd \u1f26\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9 \u03bd\u03cc\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2).

This is a good notion; and, to prevent any other getting into our heads, let us go on to Ares. He is the manly one (\u1f04\u03c1\u03c1\u03b7\u03bd), or the unchangeable one (\u1f04\u03c1\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2). Enough of the Gods; for, by the Gods, I am afraid of them; but if you suggest other words, you will see how the horses of Euthyphro prance. \u2018Only one more God; tell me about my godfather Hermes.\u2019 He is \u1f11\u03c1\u03bc\u03b7\u03bd\u03b5\u1f7a\u03c2, the messenger or cheater or thief or bargainer; or \u1f41 \u03b5\u1f34\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd \u03bc\u1f60\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, that is, \u03b5\u1f30\u03c1\u03ad\u03bc\u03b7\u03c2 or \u1f15\u03c1\u03bc\u03b7\u03c2 \u2014 the speaker or contriver of speeches. \u2018Well said Cratylus, then, that I am no son of Hermes.\u2019 Pan, as the son of Hermes, is spe", "output": "cially called \u1f19\u03c1\u03bc\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b5\u03ba\u03bd\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u1f78\u03c2.\nCratylus: How, then, did you get into the habit of speaking of the Gods in this way?\nSocrates: I was born into it, and you were not.\nCratylus: But I was not born into it, and yet I speak of them in the same way.\nSocrates: Then you have been taught, as I have.\nCratylus: I have not been taught, but I have learnt the language from my parents.\n", "target": null}, {"prompt": "ech or the brother of speech, and is called Pan because speech indicates everything\u2014\u1f41 \u03c0\u00e2\u03bd \u03bc\u03b7\u03bd\u03cd\u03c9\u03bd.

The letters \u03b4 and \u03c4 convey the idea of binding and rest in a place: the \u03bb denotes smoothness, as in the words slip, sleek, sleep, and the like. But when the slipping tongue is detained by the heavier sound of \u03b3, then arises the notion of a glutinous clammy nature: \u03bd is sounded from within, and has a notion of inwardness: \u03b1 is the expression of size; \u03b7 of length; \u03bf of roundness, and therefore there is plenty of \u03bf in the word \u03b3\u03cc\u03b3\u03b3\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd.

He was probably also the first who made a distinction between simple and compound words, a truth second only in importance to that which has just been mentioned.

Secondly, he shows that the knowledge of the objects of sense is not sufficient for the attainment of truth; the mind must be able to express its ideas in words, in order that they may be communicated to others.

But he is covertly satirising the pretence of that or any other age to find philosophy in words; and he afterwards corrects any erroneous inference which might be gathered from his experiment. For he finds as many, or almost as many, words expressive of rest, as he had previously found expressive of motion. And even if this had been otherwise, who would learn of words when he might learn of things? There is a great controversy and high argument between Heracleiteans and Eleatics, but no man of sense would commit his soul in such enquiries to the imposers of names. . . In this and other passages Plato shows that he is as completely emancipated from the influence of \u2018Idols of the tribe\u2019 as Bacon himself.\nThe lesson which may be gathered from words is not metaphysical or moral, but historical.

It was the subject of a controversy between Plato and Heracleitus. Plato thought that language was a mere conventional device, and that the meaning of words was merely arbitrary; Heracleitus, on the other hand, maintained that language was a natural and necessary instrument for the expression of the truth.

Nor in any case is the invention of them the result of philosophical reflection; they have been commonly transferred from matter to mind, and their meaning is the very reverse of their etymology. Because there is or is not a name for a thing, we cannot argue that the thing has or has not an actual existence; or that the antitheses, parallels, conjugates, correlatives of language have anything corresponding to them in nature. There are too many words as well as too few; and they generalize the objects or ideas which they represent.

He is willing to admit that they are subject to many changes, and put on many disguises. He acknowledges that the \u2018poor creature\u2019 imitation is supplemented by another \u2018poor creature,\u2019\u2014convention. But he does not see that \u2018habit and repute,\u2019 and their relation to other words, are always exercising an influence over them. Words appear to be isolated, but they are really the parts of an organism which is always being reproduced.

They carry with them the faded recollection of their own past history; the use of a word in a striking and familiar passage gives a complexion to its use everywhere else, and the new use of an old and familiar phrase has also a peculiar power over us. But these and other subtleties of language escaped the observation of Plato.

Philosophers have sometimes dreamed of a technical or scientific language, in words which should have fixed meanings, and stand in the same relation to one another as the substances which they denote. But there is no more trace of this in Plato than there is of a language corresponding to the ideas; nor, indeed, could the want of such a language be felt until the sciences were far more developed. Those who would extend the use of technical phraseology beyond the limits of science or of custom, seem to forget that freedom and suggestiveness and the play of association are essential characteristics of language. The great master has shown how he regarded pedantic distinctions of words or attempts to confine their meaning in the satire on Prodicus in the Protagoras.\n(5) In addition to these anticipations of the general principles of philol", "output": "ology, the Platonic writings furnish a mass of facts and materials which have been of great service to the philologists of the last century.

Nor indeed is induction applicable to philology in the same degree as to most of the physical sciences.

What is the result of recent speculations about the origin and nature of language? Like other modern metaphysical enquiries, they end at last in a statement of facts. But, in order to state or understand the facts, a metaphysical insight seems to be required. There are more things in language than the human mind easily conceives. And many fallacies have to be dispelled, as well as observations made.

Yet into the formation of those words have entered causes which the human mind is not capable of calculating. They are a drop or two of the great stream or ocean of speech which has been flowing in all ages. They have been transmitted from one language to another; like the child himself, they go back to the beginnings of the human race. How they originated, who can tell? Nevertheless we can imagine a stage of human society in which the circle of men\u2019s minds was narrower and their sympathies and instincts stronger; in which their organs of speech were more flexible, and the sense of hearing finer and more discerning; in which they lived more in company, and after the manner of ch", "output": "oruses and in the harmony of the human voice.

At first there would be few such cries, and little danger of mistaking or confusing them.

Necessarily the pictorial image becomes less vivid, while the association of the nature and habits of the animal is more distinctly perceived. The picture passes into a symbol, for there would be too many of them and they would crowd the mind; the vocal imitation, too, is always in process of being lost and being renewed, just as the picture is brought back again in the description of the poet.

The earliest parts of speech, as we may call them by anticipation, like the first utterances of children, probably partook of the nature of interjections and nouns; then came verbs; at length the whole sentence appeared, and rhythm and metre followed. Each stage in the progress of language was accompanied by some corresponding stage in the mind and civilization of man.

Yet we are far from saying that this or any other theory of language is proved by facts.

The organs of language are the same in all mankind, and are only capable of uttering a certain number of sounds.

No inference can be drawn from language, either for or against the unity of the human race. Nor is there any proof that words were ever used without any relation to each other. Whatever may be the meaning of a sentence or a word when applied to primitive language, it is probable that the sentence is more akin to the original form than the word, and that the later stage of language is the result rather of analysis than of synthesis, or possibly is a combination of the two. Nor, again, are we sure that the original process of learning to speak was the same in different places or among different races of men. It may have been slower with some, quicker with others.

And there are many reasons why a man should prefer his own way of speaking to that of others, unless by so doing he becomes unintelligible. The struggle for existence among words is not of that fierce and irresistible kind in which birds, beasts and fishes devour one another, but of a milder sort, allowing one usage to be substituted for another, not by force, but by the persuasion, or rather by the prevailing habit, of a majority.

This is the case with writers who are not familiar with the language, and the more so with those who are. The reason of this is obvious.

But in both cases the newly\u2013created forms soon become fixed; there are few if any vestiges of the intermediate links, and so the better half of the evidence of the change is wanting.\n(3) Among the incumbrances or illusions of language may be reckoned many of the rules and traditions of grammar, whether ancient grammar or the corrections of it which modern philology has introduced.

We have also sought to indicate the sources of our knowledge of it and the spirit in which we should approach it. We may now proceed to consider some of the principles or natural laws which have created or modified it.\ni. The first and simplest of all the principles of language, common also to the animals, is imitation. The lion roars, the wolf howls in the solitude of the forest: they are answered by similar cries heard from a distance. The bird, too, mimics the voice of man and makes answer to him. Man tells to man the secret place in which he is hiding himself; he remembers and repeats the sound which he has heard. The love of imitation becomes a passion and an instinct to him.

We may still remark how much greater and more natural the exercise of the power is in the use of language than in any other process or action of the human mind.\nii. Imitation provided the first material of language: but it was \u2018without form and void.\u2019 During how many years or hundreds or thousands of years the imitative or half\u2013articulate stage continued there is no possibility of determining. But we may reasonably conjecture that there was a time when the vocal utterance of man was intermediate between what we now call language and the cry of a bird or animal.

In every sentence, in every word and every termination of a word, this power of forming relations to one another was contained. There was a proportion of sound to sound, of meaning to meaning, of meaning to sound. The cases and numbers of nouns, the persons, tenses, numbers of verbs, were generally on the same or nearly the same pattern and had the same meaning. The sounds by which they were expressed were rough\u2013hewn at first; after a while they grew more refined\u2014the natural laws of euphony began to affect them. The rules of syntax are likewise based upon analogy. Time has an analogy with space, arithmetic with geometry.

In Greek there are three declensions of nouns; the forms of cases in one of them may intrude upon another. Similarly verbs in \u2013\u03c9 and \u2013\u03bc\u03b9 interchange forms of tenses, and the completed paradigm of the verb is often made up of both. The same nouns may be partly declinable and partly indeclinable, and in some of their cases may have fallen out of use. Here are rules with exceptions; they are not however really exceptions, but contain in themselves indications of other rules. Many of these interruptions or variations of analogy occur in pronouns or in the verb of existence of which the forms were too common and therefore too deeply imbedded in language entirely to drop out.

Like number from which it seems to be derived, the principle of analogy opens the eyes of men to discern the similarities and differences of things, and their relations to one another. At first these are such as lie on the surface only; after a time they are seen by men to reach farther down into the nature of things. Gradually in language they arrange themselves into a sort of imperfect system; groups of personal and case endings are placed side by side.

So not without admixture and confusion and displacement and contamination of sounds and the meanings of words, a lower stage of language passes into a higher. Thus far we can see and no further.

The old onomatopea of primitive language was refined into an onomatopea of a higher kind, in which it is no longer true to say that a particular sound corresponds to a motion or action of man or beast or movement of nature, but that in all the higher uses of language the sound is the echo of the sense, especially in poetry, in which beauty and expressiveness are given to human thoughts by the harmonious composition of the words, syllables, letters, accents, quantities, rhythms, rhymes, varieties and contrasts of all sorts.

How did the roots or substantial portions of words become modified or inflected? and how did they receive separate meanings? First we remark that words are attracted by the sounds and senses of other words, so that they form groups of nouns and verbs analogous in sound and sense to one another, each noun or verb putting forth inflexions, generally of two or three patterns, and with exceptions. We do not say that we know how sense became first allied to sound; but we have no difficulty in ascertaining how the sounds and meanings of words were in time parted off or differentiated. (1) The chief causes which regulate the variations of sound are (a) double or differing analogies, which lead sometimes to one form, sometimes to another; (b) euphony, by which is meant chiefly the greater pleasure to the ear and the greater facility to the organs of speech which is given by a new formation or pronunciation of a word; (c) the necessity of finding new expressions for new classes or pro", "output": "totypes of objects, or of the sensations excited by them; (d) the necessity of finding new names for new words, which may be the same as those of old words, or may be different; (e) the necessity of finding new names for old words, which may be the same as those of the old words, or may be different; (f) the necessity of finding new words for old words, which may be the same as those of the old words, or may be different; (g) the necessity of finding new words for new words, which may be the same as those of the old words,", "target": null}, {"prompt": "cesses of things. We are told that changes of sound take place by innumerable gradations until a whole tribe or community or society find themselves acquiescing in a new pronunciation or use of language. Yet no one observes the change, or is at all aware that in the course of a lifetime he and his contemporaries have appreciably varied their intonation or use of words. On the other hand, the necessities of language seem to require that the intermediate sounds or meanings of words should quickly become fixed or set and not continue in a state of transition (see above, p. 303). The process of settling down is aided by the organs of speech and by the use of writing and printing. (2) The meaning of words varies because ideas vary or the number of things which is included under them or with which they are associated is increased. A single word is thus made to do duty for many more things than were formerly expressed by it; and it parts into different senses when the classes of things or ideas which are represented", "output": "by it are divided. The same word may be used in a general and in a special sense. (3) Words are varied by the formation of new ones. It is a natural result of the growth of language that new words are formed to express new ideas, and that the old words are changed to suit the new ideas. The formation of new words is a slow process. In the course of time, however, they become common and familiar and are used in ordinary conversation.

It is a natural result of the growth of language that words which", "target": null}, {"prompt": " by it are themselves different and distinct. A figurative use of a word may easily pass into a new sense: a new meaning caught up by association may become more important than all the rest. The good or neutral sense of a word, such as Jesuit, Puritan, Methodist, Heretic, has been often converted into a bad one by the malevolence of party spirit. Double forms suggest different meanings and are often used to express them; and the form or accent of a word has been not unfrequently altered when there is a difference of meaning. The difference of gender in nouns is utilized for the same reason. New meanings of words push themselves into the vacant spaces of language and retire when they are no longer needed. Language equally abhors vacancy and superfluity.

We may now speak briefly of the faults of language. They may be compared to the faults of Geology, in which different strata cross one another or meet at an angle, or mix with one another either by slow transitions or by violent convulsions, leaving many lacunae which can be no longer filled up, and often becoming so complex that no true explanation of them can be given. So in language there are the cross influences of meaning and sound, of logic and grammar, of differing analogies, of words and the inflexions of words, which often come into conflict with each other. The grammarian, if he were to form new words, would make them all of the same pattern according to what he conceives to be the rule, that is, the more common usage of language. The subtlety of nature goes far beyond art, and it is complicated by irregularity, so that often we can hardly say that there is a right or wrong in the formation of words.

The verses have been repeated as a chant or part of a ritual, but they have had no relation to ordinary life or speech.

So they continued to be in parts of the country in which writing was not used or in which there was no diffusion of literature. In most of the counties of England there is still a provincial style, which has been sometimes made by a great poet the vehicle of his fancies. When a book sinks into the mind of a nation, such as Luther\u2019s Bible or the Authorized English Translation of the Bible, or again great classical works like Shakspere or Milton, not only have new powers of expression been diffused through a whole nation, but a great step towards uniformity has been made.

The latter are regarded as furnishing a type of excellence to which the former cannot attain. But the truth seems to be that modern languages, if through the loss of inflections and genders they lack some power or beauty or expressiveness or precision which is possessed by the ancient, are in many other respects superior to them: the thought is generally clearer, the connection closer, the sentence and paragraph are better distributed.

It is a popular remark that our great writers are beginning to disappear: it may also be remarked that whenever a great writer appears in the future he will find the English language as perfect and as ready for use as in the days of Shakespere or Milton. There is no reason to suppose that English or French will ever be reduced to the low level of Modern Greek or of Mediaeval Latin. The wide diffusion of great authors would make such a decline impossible. Nor will modern languages be easily broken up by amalgamation with each other. The distance between them is too wide to be spanned, the differences are too great to be overcome, and the use of printing makes it impossible that one of them should ever be lost in another.\nThe structure of the English language differs greatly from that of either Latin or Greek.

In English the majority of sentences are independent and in apposition to one another; they are laid side by side or slightly connected by the copula. But within the sentence the expression of the logical relations of the clauses is closer and more exact: there is less of apposition and participial structure. The sentences thus laid side by side are also constructed into paragraphs; these again are less distinctly marked in Greek and Latin than in English. Generally French, German, and English have an advantage over the classical languages in point of accuracy. The three concords are more accurately observed in English than in either Greek or Latin.

Of the comparative effect of accent and quantity and of the relation between them in ancient and modern languages we are not able to judge.\nAnother quality in which modern are superior to ancient languages is freedom from tautology. No English style is thought tolerable in which, except for the sake of emphasis, the same words are repeated at short intervals. Of course the length of the interval must depend on the character of the word. Striking words and expressions cannot be allowed to reappear, if at all, except at the distance of a page or more.

And the mind equally rejects the repetition of the word and the use of a mere synonym for it,\u2014e.g. felicity and happiness. The cultivated mind desires something more, which a skilful writer is easily able to supply out of his treasure\u2013house.\nThe fear of tautology has doubtless led to the multiplications of words and the meanings of words, and generally to an enlargement of the vocabulary. It is a very early instinct of language; for ancient poetry is almost as free from tautology as the best modern writings. The speech of young children, except in so far as they are compelled to repeat themselves by the fewness of their words, also escapes from it. When they grow up and have ideas which are beyond their powers of expression, especially in writing, tautology begins to appear.

At first mankind were contented to express their thoughts in a set form of words having a kind of rhythm; to which regularity was given by accent and quantity. But after a time they demanded a greater degree of freedom, and to those who had all their life been hearing poetry the first introduction of prose had the charm of novelty. The prose romances into which the Homeric Poems were converted, for a while probably gave more delight to the hearers or readers of them than the Poems themselves, and in time the relation of the two was reversed: the poems which had once been a necessity of the human mind became a luxury: they were now superse", "output": "eded by the prose romances which were the first attempts to represent the real world, and to which the mind of the people had already been habituated.\nThe earliest prose romances were of a simple character, and were almost all founded on mythology.

Most of us have experienced a sort of delight and feeling of curiosity when we first came across or when we first used for ourselves a new word or phrase or figure of speech.\nThere are associations of sound and of sense by which every word is linked to every other.

Lexicons assign to each word a definite meaning or meanings. They both tend to obscure the fact that the sentence precedes the word and that all language is relative. (1) It is relative to its own context. Its meaning is modified by what has been said before and after in the same or in some other passage: without comparing the context we are not sure whether it is used in the same sense even in two successive sentences.
